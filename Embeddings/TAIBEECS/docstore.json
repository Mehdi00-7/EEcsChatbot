You have chosen an exciting yet fast-evolving and demanding discipline, which plays an increasingly central role in our lives. Thank you forchoosing us! By doing this, you have selected one of the great places in the UK to study. According to the latest Research Exercise Framework (REF) carried in2021 (https://www.ref.ac.uk/), EECS is ranked top 8 in the UK for CS and engineering as a whole discipline is ranked 7th in the UK.As we're moving away from the Covid-19 pandemic, our educational provision is based on a largely in-person provision, complemented by online activitieswhere appropriate. Studying at University is very di!erent from other learning environments. Indeed, at University, you have to find out how best you learn, so alarge part of what you do and how you do it is your choice. Let me make a few suggestions to help you make the most of your time at University.First, work consistently from the start: It isn't easy to catch up if you get behind. Keeping up with the materials and assessments is therefore critical. Beingorganised is an essential life skill you must learn and master during your time with us.Take advantage of all activities, in-person and online, e.g., discussions, forums, and keep regular contact with your fellow students, module lecturers and advisor.Engage with the material, by asking questions: teachers are here to help you learn, but you must ask questions if you want answers.Next, be informed: Read the information in this handbook and on the College and School web-pages. Also, please read your email, especially communicationsfrom your teachers and teaching services. These communications exist to inform you and save you time. Not reading them will waste everyone's time, both onthe part of the sta! and yours. It is a matter of respect, courtesy, and professionalism that we all are informed.It is never too soon to start thinking about life a\"er University. You will learn many skills while at University, beyond purely technical ones, to help you with yourfuture career. The University and School take Graduate Attributes very seriously, to find out more, please visit the School student intranet or go to the followinglink: http://www.qmul.ac.uk/docs/gacep/38598.pdfEquality, diversity and Inclusion are things we value significantly within EECS and QMUL as a whole. In EECS, you should feel at home regardless of gender,sexuality, gender identity, race, or religious beliefs. We expect and require all students to behave in line with these values. We expect students to show respecttowards each other and our sta!, whether in person or online. A range of disciplinary measures exist and will be applied if necessary in cases of misbehaviour.Most of our students go on to successful careers and have a remarkably satisfying experience studying with us. We hope your studies will go smoothly, but pleasecome and tell us sooner rather than later if you have any problems. We will always try to help.We believe that Electronic Engineering and Computer Science are enjoyable and rewarding disciplines. We hope that you will share our beliefs. Take an interestin what is happening in the School; for instance, attend some of the regular talks given by visiting experts during term-time. Take time to appreciate otheraspects of University life, such as the Students' Union's activities.Best Wishes,Professor UhligHead Of School", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3680, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8806249e-0803-48e4-af31-71a589332c79": {"__data__": {"id_": "8806249e-0803-48e4-af31-71a589332c79", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f4cc1bab-7c7e-4aff-8a9d-e8efdeead3ae", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "hash": "77d5f1d376a86fdb1b5348af065030532bf30cc253522556e0dff888fe20cfab", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "18/01/2024, 2:46\u202fpmEECS Student Handbook 2023/24 | MyQMUL\nPage 11 of 82https://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/mod/book/tool/print/index.php?id=2444971", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 137, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a638fbe8-d4c4-42df-b547-079e05479f31": {"__data__": {"id_": "a638fbe8-d4c4-42df-b547-079e05479f31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2c5aee25-2fc5-4efe-8fa3-7362e49da870", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "hash": "3e9ac979fe88de35771168039de4a0c83bd1eb76c68913664be197cb378e15a6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "18/01/2024, 2:46\u202fpmEECS Student Handbook 2023/24 | MyQMUL\nPage 12 of 82https://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/mod/book/tool/print/index.php?id=24449713.2 Mission StatementQUEEN MARY\u2019S MISSION STATEMENTThe mission of Queen Mary is:To create a truly inclusive environment, building on our cherished cultural diversity, where students and sta! flourish, reach their full potential and are proud tobe part of the University.

Guidance on where and when to collect yourcard can be be found here: https://www.qmul.ac.uk/newstudents/enrolment/student-id/. This card is very important, and must be carried at all times oncampus. If you do not produce this card upon request and satisfy sta! that it is your card through comparison of your face and the photograph, you may beremoved from the building, or from campus. Misuse of your card will normally lead to an investigation under the Code of Student Discipline(http://www.arcs.qmul.ac.uk/students/student-appeals/misconduct/)The card shows your student number. You must take your card into all face-to-face examinations, and display it on your desk for inspection. You will also need tocopy the student number onto your paper.The card also serves as your library card, and as an access card for certain buildings and equipment (such as printers and photocopiers). Many buildings havesecurity points at which you must show your card, and others require you to scan your card to release the doors.You may also be required to present your card to confirm your attendance (e.g you may need to touch your card on a reader in a lecture theatre).It is vital that you keep your card safe and with you at all times on campus. If you lose your card, or if your card is stolen, you should obtain a replacement fromthe Student Enquiry Centre (http://www.arcs.qmul.ac.uk/students/sec/student-card/index.html).

In addition, you will be allocated a personalacademic adviser.All students are allocated a personal adviser for the duration of your studies. Advisers are members of academic sta! who provide advice and support tostudents. They have two main roles: academic and pastoral.In their academic capacity, advisers advise on, and approve, programmes of study. If you are considering changing your programme of study, or taking a modulethat does not appear on your recommended programme, you must discuss this with your adviser. Any other academic-related concerns, e.g. general academicprogress, should be discussed with your adviser in the first instance. Please note that, in this School, the role of adviser is separate from that of Senior Tutor.In their pastoral capacity, advisers are the first point of contact in case of personal problems or concerns. Advisers recognise that personal problems can severelya!ect a student\u2019s academic performance, and they will provide a sympathetic and non-judgmental ear, as well as practical help. They can also direct students toother QM support services, where appropriate. Discussions with students will always be treated in confidence. However, in cases where academic performance isa!ected by personal problems, the School must be o!icially informed, and advisers can also guide students through the correct procedures for doing this. Advisers can be asked to provide academic references for students for job and other applications a\"er leaving university, and this is another good reason forbuilding and maintaining a good student/adviser relationship. If your Adviser, Year Tutor, or Senior Tutor is not available you should contact the Student Support O!icer.How do I know who my Adviser is?The name of your adviser will be shown on your EECS landing page.  A time will be set for you to meet with your adviser within the first 2 weeks of term. First yearstudents will meet regularly with their adviser throughout the first and second semester. It is your responsibility as a student to attend these meetings.Advice and CounsellingThe Advice and Counselling Service o!ers a free and confidential service to all Queen Mary students.  This should be the first point of call for internationalstudents with visa issues.  Advice and Counselling are located on the ground floor of the Geography Building at Mile End and are open on weekdays throughoutthe year, including most vacations.  Further information can be found at http://www.welfare.qmul.ac.ukFeedback and Student VoicesWe encourage all students to feedback to us and we are keen to hear and act on student voices.The School has five ways in which feedback can be given: Meeting with your personal advisorStudent Support page Student Representatives who are a voice for your programme, details can be found at - https://www.qmsu.org/reps/coursereps/ andhttps://intranet.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/admin/sslc.Student Sta! Liaison committees (SSLC) which are held twice a semester and your student reps attend these on your behalf to give feedback to the School,the reps will contact you, usually via email, so please do feedback to them.Module feedback questionnaire \u2013 you will be given an opportunity to give anonymous feedback at module level in each semester.The above should be seen as the main avenue for giving feedback on your module, programme and experience at university.

This is to ensure that students arewell supported and given every opportunity to progress with their studies and to achieve to their fullest potential whilst here.1.                  MARKERS OF STUDENT ENGAGEMENT 1.1               Attendance: In our experience we have seen that there is a positive relationship between regular attendance and engagement and academic success. The school monitorsattendance and engagement for the student's benefit. Consistent absenteeism indicates that a student is not engaging with the programme which for the Schoolof EECS is the point at which support is made available in order to help the individual get back on track. For the reasons mentioned above you should attend all lectures and labs and any other events that are part of your modules. If you are absent from College formore than a day or two you will need to inform the Student Support O!icer at the earliest opportunity, similarly if something serious such as an illness preventsyou from attending. One of the ways your attendance and engagement is monitored during your lab sessions, is by looking at log in data from the computers inthe ITL. If you use your own lap top during your lab sessions, you will not be marked as present in your assigned lab for this reason you should log into one of themachines in the lab during your session then return to using your own lap top (if necessary).Poor attendance will result in the Senior Tutor/Student Support O!icer sending a notice to your Queen Mary email address. It will also have a significantlynegative e!ect on your studies.  1.2               Coursework Submission: You are expected to submit reports, exercises, essays, and other pieces of coursework associated with each module for which you are registered as part of yourprogramme of study, by the individually advertised deadlines and method of submission. This is also another way in which your attendance and engagement ismonitored.  1.3               Participation in Formative Assessments: You are expected to participate in a range of activities (with or without the allocation of marks) that help to inform teaching and learning during the learningprocess. Examples of such activities are subject related quizzes, or exercises linked to module materials on QM+.  1.4               Marks from Summative Assessments: You are expected to participate in a range of activities assessing the outcomes of a learning process. Provisional and/or confirmed marks allocated from suchsummative assessments e.g weekly tests, coursework, and Examinations, o\"en contribute to the overall module grade and programme degree classification. 1.5               Other Student Engagement Activities: You are expected to participate in a range of formal or informal activities that signify continued engagementwith their programme of study. Examples of such activities are scheduled meetings with Personal Tutors/Academic Advisers, tutorials and group work.2                    ACTION FOLLOWING IDENTIFICATION OF STUDENTS WHO MAY REQUIRE SUPPORT2.1               Actions by Schools are designed to support students to engage or re-engage with their study programme. The underpinning principles are that theSchool, once it has admitted a student to a programme of study, has a duty of care to that student, whilst in turn the student has a responsibility to engage withthe available support. In such cases, support will be designed by the School around the needs of the individual student. 2.2               A student identified as approaching or falling below the minimum requirements of engagement set by their School will be contacted alerting them tothis, outlining support mechanisms to deal with the issues that may be contributing to this. 2.3               Once a student is identified as in need of support in order to re-engage with their studies, they will be invited to a meeting with their PersonalTutor/Academic Adviser to discuss issues that might be a!ecting  their  studies, and  for  the provision  of encouragement/advice (with possible referral to QMsupport services if necessary). The first port of call is the Personal Tutor/Academic Adviser, who in turn may liaise with the Senior Tutor and the School\u2019s StudentSupport O!icer. In exceptional circumstances, a senior member of the School team, such as the Director of Taught Programmes or the Head of School, may beinvolved in this process.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4696, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f3319cf-36a5-4b8b-ae12-0e8f2b0cd704": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f3319cf-36a5-4b8b-ae12-0e8f2b0cd704", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "91df6da5-d2a2-430a-b39f-a60d653d8dab", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "hash": "8625f8478578e49d04b55daf13f430208e89b3e01345cb057f58251fa5362303", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b2d21dbb-0d1a-4255-8408-bd4d175b6447", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "hash": "27a05cba9285d206b448d89167a398d2c2906b3783751c1cad3837944904846a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "2.2               A student identified as approaching or falling below the minimum requirements of engagement set by their School will be contacted alerting them tothis, outlining support mechanisms to deal with the issues that may be contributing to this. 2.3               Once a student is identified as in need of support in order to re-engage with their studies, they will be invited to a meeting with their PersonalTutor/Academic Adviser to discuss issues that might be a!ecting  their  studies, and  for  the provision  of encouragement/advice (with possible referral to QMsupport services if necessary).

Please note that a FormalAppeal  cannot provide feedback on academic work.Appeals against academic judgment are not permitted, this means you cannot appeal simply because you think the mark you have received is too low.There are two grounds for appeal:procedural error: Where the process leading to the decision being appealed against was not conducted in accordance with Queen Mary\u2019s procedure, suchthat there is reasonable doubt as to whether the outcome might have been di!erent had the error not occurred. Procedural error shall include allegedadministrative or clerical error, and bias in the operation of the procedure.that exceptional circumstances, illness, or other relevant factors were not made known at the time for good reason, or were not properly taken intoaccount.A Formal Appeal must be received within 14 calendar days of the notification of the decision you want to appeal and should be submitted from your Queen Maryemail to appeals@qmul.ac.uk.Further information about how to appeal and the appeal form can be found on the Queen Mary website: http://www.arcs.qmul.ac.uk/students/student-appeals/appeals/index.htmlIf you are not satisfied with the outcome of your appeal you may submit a Final Review for consideration by the Principal\u2019s nominee. Once a Final Review iscomplete you will be sent a Completion of Procedures letter which outlines the final decision of Queen Mary and the reasons for the decision.ComplaintsBefore submitting a Formal Complaint you are advised to speak to a member of sta! in your School/Institute as most issues can be resolved informally withoutthe need for a formal complaint.If your issue is not resolved through the informal process then you will need to complete the Formal Complaint form and submit this to the relevantSchool/Institute/Professional Services Head for investigation under the Student Complaints Policy:http://www.arcs.qmul.ac.uk/students/student-appeals/complaints/index.htmlMost complaints are resolved at the Formal Complaint stage but if your matter is still not resolved then there is one review stage to the policy.When the complaint process is finished you will be issued with a Completion of Procedures letter explaining the final decision and the reasons for it.O!ice of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA)If you are unhappy with the outcome of an appeal or complaint then you may submit a complaint to the OIA within 12 months of receiving your Completion ofProcedures letter. The OIA is the independent body set up to review student complaints and is free to students.

Health problems include your emotional wellbeing and mental health, as well as yourphysical health. Extenuating circumstances do not include computer problems, misreading your exam timetable, planned holidays or events, or local transportdelays.Fit to Sit Policy:Queen Mary operates a fit to sit policy, which covers all assessments including coursework and exams. If you sit an exam or submit a piece of coursework you aredeemed to be fit to do so. In such instances a request for extenuating circumstances will not normally be considered. If you do not feel you are well enough toattend an invigilated exam then you should not attend and should submit a claim for extenuating circumstances instead. You will need to attend a medicalconsultation within three days of the date of your exam that you missed. Similarly if you get sick during an exam and have to leave you will need to attend amedical consultation within three days. How to Submit an Extenuating Circumstance Request:To submit an extenuating circumstance request you must log a claim through the online extenuating circumstances task on MySIS [add web address] following the instructions there. Claims must be submitted by [give specific deadline]. If you have queries contact [o!ice/person/email address]. Required Supporting Evidence:Your claim must be accompanied by relevant supporting evidence (for example medical certification, death certificate, police report and crime number, or otherwritten evidence from a person in authority). Please note that although accompanying documentation can be submitted a\"er the claim, claims without anyevidence cannot be considered except in the limited cases permitted for self-certification, below . It is in your best interest to provide evidence and supportingdocumentation that is as comprehensive as possible.Self-Certification Option:You are entitled to self-certify on up to three occasions each academic year; each self-certification can cover a period of up to seven calendar days. This meanscompleting and submitting the Queen Mary self-certification form in place of independent evidence. Please note that self-certification does not mean automaticapproval of a claim \u2013 your school/institute will consider it in the normal way and will need to be satisfied of the validity of the claim, and satisfied that it justifiesthe outcome. Any claims beyond those three must be accompanied by evidence, as described above.When you submit an extenuating circumstance claim you will receive a formal acknowledgement , you must keep this safe for the duration of your studies. Submission Deadline:All claims must be received no later than three working days before the relevant examination board meeting [give date] otherwise they cannot be considered.Confidentiality:All extenuating circumstances claims are kept confidential until they are considered by a subcommittee of the School/Institute\u2019s Subject Examination Board. Allproceedings of the subcommittee are strictly confidential, and will not normally be discussed at the full examination board meeting. Responsibility for Submitting Claims:It is your own responsibility to submit any claims for extenuating circumstances, not that of your tutor. Please ensure that if you have what you believe is a validcase, you complete the submission process in accordance with the School/Institute guidelines and deadlines.Retrospective Claims:It is not possible to make a retrospective claim for extenuating circumstances, specifically once you know your results. Therefore claims submitted a\"er thedeadline will not be considered by the examination board.

Let\u2019s begin with the basics! Learner Engagement Analytics is a term that is used to describe the data the University holds about your engagement with variousservices, as well as your demographic data. Learner Engagement Analytics is o\"en referred to as LEA, so you may also have heard about it under that name.Currently, your engagement data comes from the digital footprints that you leave when you use QMPlus and other University systems and data about yourgrades and academic history. When all this data about you is brought together in one system, it\u2019s called Learner Engagement Analytics. The following types of data may be used for the LEA system at Queen Mary:\u00b7         Background information: your name, identifiers used by the University, contact details, and a link to the photo we hold of you.\u00b7         Details about your course, the modules you are taking, the credits you have achieved and your advisers.\u00b7         Details of your assessments, marks and grades obtained.\u00b7         Details of your activity in QMPlus and other digital systems: such as logins, resources viewed,  and assessments submitted and graded.\u00b7         Details about your engagement with teaching activities, such as attendance.\u00b7         Any extenuating circumstances that have been approved.\u00b7         As part of the ongoing development of the LEA platform we will be including some data about your use of reading lists.\u00b7         We may link data for Statistical Purposes only to your date of birth, ethnicity, gender, declared disabilities, entry qualifications, whether your parents werein higher education, your socio-economic background, and whether you are an overseas student. Two of these data types are what is known as special categorypersonal data: Ethnicity and Disability.  They are being included within our models to improve our monitoring of equality of opportunity and improve theaccuracy of the models. By conducting statistical analyses, we can distinguish various engagement patterns among di!erent groups without identifyingindividuals. These analyses will be conducted anonymously. As you can see, LEA has a lot to do with you \u2013 it\u2019s data about you! The University has collected this data about you for a long time, but the University has decidedto create a system that brings your data from di!erent sources together, and this system is going to be used to analyse your data to better understand andsupport your journey through the University. What will my data be used for? It\u2019s good to be careful with your personal data, and we can assure you that your data will only be used to improve the student experience and provide tailoredsupport when you need it. For example, in Schools where LEA has been implemented, if we can see that your engagement has decreased, your Advisor and thestudent support sta! in your School might reach out to you to see if you need a bit of extra support to get back on track. Another benefit is that the engagementdata from all the students in your cohort can help academic sta! to improve their learning materials. If a lecturer can see that most students in your class aren\u2019topening the resources on QMPlus, it might be sign that they need to redesign the QMPlus page, so it is easier for you to access the right resources at the righttime. Now that you know what we do with your data, we also want to make it clear that your data will never be used for assessment unless you have explicitly beentold that this is the case (this is only the case for a small minority of courses that have relied on engagement data for assessment for a long time, so this isn\u2019t anew feature of the LEA system). Similarly, if we can see that you have disengaged, the LEA system will never be used to make any automatic decisions about yourprogression.

This feature is not available yet, butwhen it becomes available, it will allow sta! to identify if you might need a bit more support. It will also be a way for you and your Advisor to discuss yourexpectations for your academic results and see if you need to adjust your engagement to make it more likely that you can achieve the results you want.I have a concern or a question.

There are a variety of ways in which you can tell uswhat you think and share your ideas for improvement. Student representatives who are elected by students also speak on behalf of the student body at School,Faculty and QM-wide level via various committees, groups and meetings.Student-Sta! Liaison Committees (SSLCs)The SSLCs provide a channel for students to air their views on all aspects of the modules and facilities run by the School.  The committee includes key membersof sta! involved in teaching, representatives of the systems and administrative sta!, the subject librarian, and representatives for each year group. The SSLCsmeet formally twice per semester. Feedback from the committees is valuable in the improvement of teaching in the School, and students are encouraged tocontribute wherever possible.The SSLC student representatives are elected by their peers. Early in the first semester, students will be asked to volunteer, or to nominate other students tostand.  An election is then held for students who consent to stand. All students are encouraged to vote for the representatives for their student group.Although individual students are free to discuss any issue with members of sta!, they may choose to channel such feedback through their SSLC representatives,especially if the issue is of widespread interest or concern to many students. Student representatives are thus active throughout the year, not just at the SSLCmeetings. If an issue requires immediate discussion, rather than waiting until the next SSLC meeting, students and/or student representatives should approachtheir tutor or the Senior Tutor in the first instance.Details of the SSLC representatives and minutes of SSLC meetings will be available on the School Intranet.Module Feedback QuestionnairesFor each module, students will be asked to fill in an anonymous online module feedback questionnaire, which solicits feedback on the delivery, content, workload and support ofthe module. This data is analysed and studied by module organisers, and passed to College for quality assurance monitoring.Towards the end of each module you will be sent an email that contains a link to an online form for each of your registered modules.NOTE: All student feedback is given anonymously. National Student SurveyAll final-year undergraduate students at UK institutions take part in the National Student Survey (NSS). The NSS is a nationally recognised annual survey ofmostly final-year undergraduates in the UK. The survey gives you an opportunity to give your opinions on what you liked about your time at Queen Mary as wellas things that you feel could have been improved.If you are a finalist, you will usually be contacted by email early in the spring term. Please do complete the NSS, and fill it in honestly.The NSS results are made publicly available to help prospective students make informed decisions of where and what to study. QMUL and the Students\u2019 Unionwill also use the data to identify areas of strengths and weaknesses to help e!ect change and bring about enhancements to improve the student experience forfuture generations of students. Data from previous surveys are available on Unistats. http://my.qmul.ac.uk/surveys/Queen Mary Student Survey (QMSS)This undergraduate survey is completed by students returning to QMUL at the beginning of an academic year, and asks you to reflect on the previous year atQMUL. It gives you the opportunity to tell us your thoughts in order to help us make the changes that you need. http://my.qmul.ac.uk/qmss/Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey (PTES)The Postgraduate Taught Experience Survey (PTES) is conducted every year. It gives you, as a postgraduate taught student, an opportunity to give your opinionson what you like about your time at QMUL, as well as those aspects that you feel could be improved. Please do consider completing the survey; your feedbackreally is invaluable and will help us make a di!erence for future generations of QMUL students. http://my.qmul.ac.uk/surveys/postgrads/", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4329, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6e533cba-3365-4e26-a9d4-da59faf0d371": {"__data__": {"id_": "6e533cba-3365-4e26-a9d4-da59faf0d371", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3d4f6900-c24a-43bc-a746-cea6b456c54f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "40", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "hash": "4e085e34510150c30b98f8ec89b9e47d86c3e48085e27d69de916b986323835d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "18/01/2024, 2:46\u202fpmEECS Student Handbook 2023/24 | MyQMUL\nPage 40 of 82https://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/mod/book/tool/print/index.php?id=2444971", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 137, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72a1b554-eec0-491f-b420-c7ee6b6583ef": {"__data__": {"id_": "72a1b554-eec0-491f-b420-c7ee6b6583ef", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "823e09c1-45ee-470a-974e-b2157957a4cc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "hash": "45d3a7663b632fdc8bb9e45cf1d15c041d359842f6d989701c4caf92a69ae524", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "18/01/2024, 2:46\u202fpmEECS Student Handbook 2023/24 | MyQMUL\nPage 41 of 82https://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/mod/book/tool/print/index.php?id=24449715.8 Student ConductBoth the School and the College have high expectations of student behaviour. Many of the points addressed below are discussed in more detail in the CollegeStudent Guide and the College\u2019s Code of Student Discipline, which are available online from Academic Registry. Specifically, the School and College expect thatstudents will treat everyone, whether a member of sta! or a fellow student, with dignity and respect at all times. Harassment of any kind, whether verbal orwritten, implicit or explicit, on account of a person\u2019s race, ethnicity, sex, religious belief, sexual orientation, disability, or any other factor, is completelyunacceptable.It is expected that students will help to maintain a pleasant atmosphere suitable for serious study throughout their programme of study. Any behaviour thatprevents other students from studying will result in disciplinary action by the School. Persistent o!enders will be referred to College for further disciplinaryaction and possible deregistration.Mobile phones should always be switched o! during taught classes, in the Library, and in any tests or examinations. Any student whose mobile phone ringsduring a taught class or in the Library may be asked to leave. Any student whose mobile phone rings during a test or examination will be referred to College fordisciplinary action. This may lead to a mark of zero being awarded for that particular assessment, and more serious penalties for a subsequent o!ence. QMUL Netiquette - Student guidelines for communicating in online contexts - https://www.qmul.ac.uk/queenmaryacademy/media/qm-academy/netiquette-guide-v5.pdfThe College code on student discipline can be found at:  http://www.arcs.qmul.ac.uk/students/student-appeals/misconduct/A School enforces a strict lab code of conduct for the benefit of all students. The lab code can be found at https://intranet.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/Conduct in the LaboratoriesAs a general guide, here are the most important points to remember:\u2022                     Help to maintain a studious atmosphere in the laboratory\u2022                     Observe all security arrangements\u2022                     Do not take food or drink into the ITL or Electronics Lab\u2022                     Keep your password secret A major risk to the computers is from food and drink. Drinks, and in particular fizzy drinks, can damage things beyond repair when spilled. We cannot a!ord toreplace the PCs if they are damaged by food or drink. Please don\u2019t take food or drink into the ITL, and do what you can to discourage others from doing so. If anyliquid is spilled on a machine, please tell a member of sta! immediately: the quicker we find out, the more chance we have of saving the machinery. The Infusionshop and cafe is close to the ITL, and there are many other places to eat and relax. Save the labs for work.Mobile phones must not be allowed to ring, and must be used considerately. They may not be used during supervised labs. Make and take your calls outsidethe building. The College doesn\u2019t intend any of its computers to be used for games. The School provides laboratories as places for study. Please respect others\u2019need to concentrate and respect the e!ort by lecturers and teaching assistants put into the labs.We are funded to maintain, service and replace the machinery for use by our students alone. It is possible for people from other departments to wander in anduse up resources to which they are not entitled.

Some modules include a small-scale project or in-term tests as part of the coursework.The weighting of examination and coursework is di!erent for individual modules and is decided by the module organiser. Students are usually required toperform to a satisfactory standard in both examination and coursework components in order to obtain an overall pass for the module, but each module has itsown specific assessment requirement.Project modules are usually assessed by means of a project report and an oral examination (viva), including a demonstration of system so\"ware whereappropriate. Students should refer to the module web pages or ask the module organiser for details of the way in which di!erent coursework elements in amodule contribute to the final module assessment.Module assessment hurdlesThere are some modules, which have a specific assessment requirement, which is normally a condition to achieve an overall mark of at least 40%. If a modulehas a coursework or exam hurdle requirement the module descriptor will show the specific condition.Example displayed on the EECS Module descriptors:A minimum total mark of 40% is required to pass this module.A minimum examination mark of 40% is required to pass this module.Undergraduate overall module pass mark is 40%Postgraduate, MSc, MEng /MSci level 7  overall module pass mark is 50%Further assessment information available here - http://www.arcs.qmul.ac.uk/students/study/module-registration/module-mark-assessment/Complaints about marks receivedIf you think that a particular piece of coursework has not been marked correctly then you should bring it to the attention of the Module Organiser for thatparticular module. However, you need to be certain that your complaint is justified because it is possible that your mark could be reduced on review. Requests toreview coursework marks should be made within two weeks of the mark being made available to you (i.e. no later than two weeks a\"er the published cut-o!date). If it appears that a mark has not been recorded correctly, then please contact the coursework administrator.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2360, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5e89079-1cd7-433b-b745-9391ec430761": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5e89079-1cd7-433b-b745-9391ec430761", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "611671a2-9e15-4a5a-9d7d-0fccb702841d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "hash": "8250cc5f6a298cac1c1a19332fd828736f3be325fbc4801075ad255cf8be4c0a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "18/01/2024, 2:46\u202fpmEECS Student Handbook 2023/24 | MyQMUL\nPage 44 of 82https://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/mod/book/tool/print/index.php?id=24449716.2 Examinations, Results and GradingEXAMINATION TIMETABLEYour individual examination timetable will be available on MySIS towards the end of December 2022 for your Semester A exams and April 2023 for your SemesterB exams.  You must check the timetable and report any errors to Registry. Please note that Registry is responsible for producing the timetable.  It is not possibleto re-arrange examinations.PROVISIONAL RESUL TSWe will try and provide your provisional results via MySIS by the end of June. Confirmed results will be made available via MySIS once the Degree ExaminationBoard has approved them. LATE SUMMER RESIT EXAMINATIONSLate summer resits will be available to all students. If you are eligible for a late summer resit you will automatically be registered.  You cannot withdraw and if youare absent it will count as a fail.  Late summer resits usually take place during the first two weeks of August and the timetable will be available in MySIS aroundmid July. Resits are now free of charge. EXAMINATION OFFENCESQMUL takes assessment and examination o!ences very seriously and so must you.  In general, calculators are not allowed in examinations, if there is anexception then this will be stated clearly in the examination rubric.  If you use a calculator where it is not permitted, you should expect to receive a mark of zerofor the examination.  It is also an o!ence to take any notes or mobile phones into the examination room.MARKING CRITERIA AND GRADINGTo view your marks for assessment, log-in to MySIS (your personal area of SIS) with your usual computer log-in, where they will be listed. These marks areprovisional and subject to change until they are agreed by the appropriate subject examination board. MySIS will indicate whether the results are provisional orconfirmed. Guides on checking your results on MySis are available on the Student Enquiry website (http://www.arcs.qmul.ac.uk/students/mysis-record/provisional-results/index.html)CLASSIFICATION AND DISCRETIONPlease be aware that the Academic Regulations are updated annualy, for this reason you should refer to the Regulations that are specific to your programme ofstudy and year of entry you can find this information here: http://www.arcs.qmul.ac.uk/policy/Examination boards may use a borderline policy when making recommendations for final degree classifications. The following criteria are used1. Students with College Marks within one per cent of a borderline (except at the pass/fail border) shall be determined to fall within the \u2018zone ofconsideration\u2019;2. Students with College Marks within 1.5 per cent of a borderline and with significant extenuating circumstances in the final year not taken into accountelsewhere may be determined to fall within the zone of consideration. However, if this approach is taken then the extenuating circumstances may not alsobe used as a reason to raise the classification itself;3. All students falling within a zone of consideration shall be considered as possible cases for application of the borderline policy;4. Students falling within the zone of consideration and with at least half of their final year credits (half of all credits at PG level) with marks at the level of theupper classification (or higher), shall be raised to the higher classification. The dissertation/project does not have to be among the credits at the higherlevel;5. Students falling within the one per cent zone of consideration and not meeting the requirements of point 4, but with significant extenuating circumstancesin the final year not taken into account elsewhere shall be raised to the higher classification provided the SEB is confident that \u2013 without the e!ect of theextenuating circumstances \u2013 the student would have achieved the higher classification.Further information on progression can be found in the Academic Regulations:http://www.arcs.qmul.ac.uk/policy/APPEALS AND COMPLAINTSBefore submitting an appeal please speak to your School/Institute about the decision you wish to appeal as many issues can be resolved without the need for anappeal.

Pay close attention to the instructions given.  Check the file format requested, any word length required, file sizes, if group submission or individual submission isrequired.Where the submission permits a dra\" submission uploaded prior to final submission you must make sure you formally submit . The submission may include  asubmit button for the final submission to be formally accepted. If you do not formally submit and the file shows as Dra\" (not submitted) the assessment may notbe marked by the module organiser, zero fail will be obtained.  If a Dra\" (not submitted) file is uploaded prior to the deadline and is marked a minimum 5%penalty will be applied. If the Dra\" (not submitted) file is submitted a\"er the deadline but before the cut o! date and is marked, the relevant late days penaltyPLUS a minimum 5% penalty will be appliedQMPlus submitted assessments are subject to the School late penalty policy.  Any submissions received a\"er the set deadline will receive a late penalty.Please note, the QM+ late time indication is not the full and final penalty to be applied. Example, it may show as 1 day late, however, the actual timestamp will be1 day and X seconds,  in this case 2 late days penalties will be applied.QMPlus group submissions.You may be required to join a group prior to submission, it is your responsibility to ensure you are in the correct group prior to submission. Not joining a groupmay result in not receiving marks for an assessment.

If  there are validextenuating circumstances then a penalty may be fully or partially waived.               i.        For every period of 24 hours, or part thereof, that an assignment is overdue there shall be a deduction of five per cent of the total marks available (i.e.five marks for an assessment marked out of 100). A\"er seven calendar days (168 hours or more late) the mark shall be reduced to zero, and recorded as 0FL (zero,fail, late).            ii.       A student may submit work of passing standard but fail the module because of the late submission penalty. Where the student is eligible for a resitattempt in such a case, the student shall not be required to resubmit the assessment; instead, the pre-deduction mark from the first attempt shall be entered forthe resit. Where a student is not eligible for a resit, this provision does not apply.              iii.        Certain assessments may cease to be a valid measure of a module\u2019s learning outcomes prior to the seven working day cut-o!. For example, wherefeedback has been provided to the class, any submission made a\"er that point would not be an accurate measure of attainment. In such cases, the latesubmission policy shall apply as normal up to the day on which feedback is given; at that point, a mark of zero (0FL) shall be applied, even if this is within sevencalendar days of the deadline. Schools and Institutes must make clear to students in advance where this variant policy applies, or else the general policy shall beapplied.            iv.       A late work penalty may be removed where a student provides good reason for the late submission under the extenuating circumstances policy. Astudent must submit a formal claim with supporting evidence in line with that policy in order for the circumstances to be considered.          v.        Schools and Institutes may award extensions to submission deadlines. This is at the discretion of the School/Institute. Where a School/Institute doesconsider the award of an extension, a student must apply before the submission date with an extenuating circumstances claim and supporting evidence. In nocircumstances shall an extension set a new deadline beyond the next meeting of the relevant Subject Examination Board (though a first sit may be awarded).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2606, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4c477ad1-1c99-4d8b-932d-8eeb52072aaa": {"__data__": {"id_": "4c477ad1-1c99-4d8b-932d-8eeb52072aaa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "18eb1bcc-63b9-44f2-a904-089b706c9d71", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "hash": "d78b4400948a749f7afee2d4418c8a570ead60ae0c4a89e0dd8410ac36b99ce6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "18/01/2024, 2:46\u202fpmEECS Student Handbook 2023/24 | MyQMUL\nPage 51 of 82https://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/mod/book/tool/print/index.php?id=24449716.8 Project module and submissionsAll EECS programmes have an individual project module.

With a variety of faiths and beliefs represented on campus, we are committed to tolerance,understanding and co-operation, as well as to ensuring as far as possible that our policies are consistent across all needs. Many religions and beliefs require theirmembers to pray at specific times during the day, or have special festivals or spiritual observance days. We recognise therefore that students at Queen Mary o\"enstrike a balance between their educational and religious commitments.One of Queen Mary\u2019s fundamental aims is to provide an education that is judged internationally to be of the highest quality. It would be both impractical andinconsistent with our aims as a university to suspend teaching for reasons of religious observance, but we will accommodate students\u2019 religious commitmentswhere we reasonably can do so. This may include providing learning materials (potentially including QReview recordings) online and permitting students toattend classes at di!erent times where there is availability.Students are expected to stay engaged and up-to-date with their studies throughout their time at Queen Mary. Schools and Institutes should make theirexpectations for attendance and submission of coursework clear to students at the beginning of their studies, and students should inform themselvesbeforehand about the potential implications of missing learning and teaching activities. Students must also inform their school or institute beforehand if theyintend to miss any teaching. We will take religious commitments into reasonable account when reviewing students\u2019 attendance, but we expect students to plantheir studies so that they can submit coursework on time.The following procedures apply in the event that a special festival or spiritual observance day would result in absence from a scheduled assessment.In the case of an in-class test, students may request permission in advance from their Head of School or Institute to be absent on that occasion. The Headof School or Institute will consider whether reasonable adjustments can be made, for example by permitting late submission or rearranging the test. It isimportant to submit requests well in advance, in case reasonable adjustments cannot be made.Students may notify Queen Mary of any special festivals or spiritual observance days that fall during formal examination periods by submitting the relevantform by the deadline specified in the Academic Calendar. We will accommodate such requests where we reasonably can do so. We are not able to makeallowances for routine religious observance during formal examination periodsQueen Mary is proud of its diverse multicultural population. With a variety of faiths among sta! and students, our facilities are designed to be places wherepeople of all faiths are welcome to use the spaces for contemplation, reflection, meditation and worship.Please, visit Faith at QMUL for further information, including facilities and services, policies and guidelines and other useful information.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3234, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2019e8e3-ae9f-448c-b2e0-95da358b3ea2": {"__data__": {"id_": "2019e8e3-ae9f-448c-b2e0-95da358b3ea2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "51eaa189-6d50-4324-9cb5-5cf9582281aa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "hash": "3e21eeee302c72b754a5be6747912d7b574cdab04df42afb27ea9b2de19a49ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "18/01/2024, 2:46\u202fpmEECS Student Handbook 2023/24 | MyQMUL\nPage 53 of 82https://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/mod/book/tool/print/index.php?id=24449716.10 Plagiarism and ReferencingPlagiarism is the failure to credit the writings or ideas of another person that you have used in your own work. In such cases you are, deliberately orinadvertently, attempting to pass their work o! as your own. Plagiarism is a serious o!ence, and can carry severe consequences, from failure of the module toderegistration from the College. You may also commit plagiarism by failing to reference your own work that you have already used in a previous essay, or byfailing to credit the input of other students on group projects.It is your responsibility to ensure that you understand plagiarism and how to avoid it. The recommendations below can help you in avoiding plagiarism.Be sure to record your sources when taking notes, and to cite these if you use ideas or, especially, quotations from the original source. Be particularlycareful if you are cutting and pasting information between two documents, and ensure that references are not lost in the process.Be sensible in referencing ideas \u2013 commonly held views that are generally accepted do not always require acknowledgment to particular sources. However,it is best to be safe to avoid plagiarism.Be particularly careful with quotations and paraphrasing.Be aware that technology is now available at Queen Mary and elsewhere that can automatically detect plagiarism.Ensure that all works used are referenced appropriately in the text of your work and fully credited in your bibliography.If in doubt, ask for further guidance from your adviser or module tutor.The material that you submit for assessment, whether in an answer script in a written examination or as assessed coursework, must be your own unaided work.Cheating in written examinations and plagiarism in assessed coursework are examination o!ences.Plagiarism in assessed coursework - this is the use or presentation of the work of another person, including another student, as your own work (or as part of yourown work) without acknowledging the source. Plagiarism therefore includes submitting the work of someone else as your own, and extensive copying fromsomeone else's work in your own paper or report.Brief quotations from the published or unpublished work of other persons may be used, but must always be clearly indicated by being placed inside quotationmarks, with the source indicated in some way, and the work listed in the bibliography at the end of your own piece of work.It can also be plagiarism to summarise another person's ideas or judgements without reference to the source.\u00b7         Copying material from web pages without acknowledgement is plagiarism. \u00b7        Copying programs (for example from the Internet) without explanation of where they are from or how much you have modified the programs is alsoplagiarism \u00b7         Copying from another student (with or without their consent) is plagiarism and both parties will be subject to investigation and possible penalty. \u00b7         Do not copy and do not allow others to copy from you.When you are taking notes for a paper or piece of coursework, it is important to include all the sources you have used, and to indicate any quotations so that youcan make the necessary references when you come to write the paper. \"Unconscious plagiarism\" , including an un-attributed quotation because you did notidentify quotations in your notes, is as much an examination o!ence as deliberate plagiarism, and will be dealt with in the same way as any other examinationo!ence.

The MEng/MSci is a four-year programmestructured into eight semesters. The two semesters in each year are referred to as Semester A (starting in September) and Semester B (starting inJanuary).Students are enrolled onto a specific degree programme or programme of study; the programme code corresponds to the UCAS code under whichthey were admitted into the School.  Most modules are worth 15 academic credits or a multiple of this value.Each programme of study specifies a set of required modules that must be taken each year, and possibly a set of optional modules, from whichstudents may choose.  This set is referred to as the recommended programme.Full details of the programmes of study and modules can be found on the Student Intranet https://intranet.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/admin/programmesInformation about programmes and modules offered by other Schools may be obtained from the appropriate School office or intranet.NOTE: Recommended programmes are updated each year and may be subject to change. There may also be restrictions on which optional modulesare available to students, according to factors such as the level (i.e. degree of difficulty) of the module, and resource and timetabling constraints. Masters ProgrammesStudents are enrolled onto a specific degree programme or programme of study. The full- time Master\u2019s degree is a one-year programme of studystructured into three semesters. The semesters in each year are referred to as Semester A (starting in September), Semester B (starting in January),and Semester C (starting in June after the exam period). Students are strongly discouraged from being away from College during their dissertation,and where this is unavoidable, permission needs to be obtained well in advance.Most modules are worth 15 academic credits or a multiple of this value. A full-time specialist or generalist Masters student takes twelve 15-creditmodules in the academic year, comprising a taught component of eight 15-credit modules followed by a dissertation/project worth four 15-creditmodules.Each programme of study specifies a set of required modules that must be taken each year, and possibly a set of optional modules, from whichstudents may choose. It is sometimes possible to follow a limited number of modules outside the recommended programme of study, but studentsmust always consult their Adviser and seek approval from the Postgraduate, Senior Tutor. It may also be possible to follow a module outside theCollege at another University of London college, if a corresponding module is not available at Queen Mary, but, again, students must consult theSenior Tutor about this.Full details of the programmes of study and modules can be found in the Computer Science recommended programmes (see the School intranet: https://intranet.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/courses) Information about programmes and modules offered by other Schools may be obtained from the appropriatedepartmental office or intranet.NOTE: Recommended programmes are updated each year and may be subject to change. There may also be restrictions on which optional modulesare available to students, according to factors such as the level (i.e. degree of difficulty) of the module, and resource and timetabling constraints. For details of classifications please review the Academic Regulations for your specific programme of study.Study AbroadThe College runs an American Universities exchange programme, under which the second year of a three-year programme of study is spent abroad.Students should note that it is necessary to initiate arrangements for this early on in the first year. However, the scheme is usually only open tostudents who achieve an overall grade of 60% or above, and entry to the programme is at the discretion of the Head of School. The School alsoparticipates in ERASMUS, an exchange programme administered by the European Union, under which students may study for a period of severalmonths, or up to a year, at a university in another country within the Union. For advice and guidance, all students should talk to the ERASMUSCoordinator in the first instance.

Full details of all EECS programmes canbe found at https://intranet.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/admin/programmes   These descriptors specify the modules which have been programmed in the StudentInformation System (SIS) and you must take.We may allow you to change your programme of study, however, you would need to discuss this with your Adviser and if necessary your Senior Tutor. If the newprogramme of study is run by another department, you will also be referred to the designated member of sta! in the department responsible for the newprogramme. If the change is approved by all departments involved, a College Change of Programme of Study form, which is available from Student SupportDesk or the Academic Registry website at http://www.arcs.qmul.ac.uk/students/study/changing-programme/index.html, must be completed and signed by amember of the Teaching Services Team and the designated member of sta! from any other department involved. The student may be assigned a newtutor/Adviser as a result of the change. Module SelectionModule registration is handled online by the QMUL Student Information System (SIS). You should choose or confirm your modules for the whole academic year before or during theenrolment period at the start on Semester A. You will have the opportunity to change the choices you made for Semester B at the start on the new term in January.To register for your modules you will need to login to MySIS http://mysis.qmul.ac.uk using your QMUL computer login details and select \u2018Module Registration\u2019from the menu on the le\".  Any core or compulsory modules will already be preselected and you will not be able to change them. Elective modules can beselected from the lists.Once you have made your module selection and are happy with your choices you should click the \u2018Submit Selections\u2019 button. This is an important step and if it isnot followed through your module choices will not go through the system. Your module selections will then be available to the Teaching Services Team.It is essential that you check your QMUL email daily and respond quickly if any of your modules registrations are rejected. Please note that it is your responsibilityto ensure that there are no timetable clashes for the modules you have selected. Module registration must be completed within the first 2 weeks of teaching.We do have some modules that have limited spaces and priority will be given to students who are required to take these as part of their recommendedprogramme.It is possible for you to modify your choices up until the second week of each semester. To do so you will need to speak to a member of the Teaching ServicesTeam and ask them to reject your selection.Can I take a module from another University of London (UoL) college?Undergradate students can take a module at another UoL college such as Kings College London, University College London, London School of Economics and theSchool of Oriental and African Studies.To register for one of these modules you will need to contact Registry and complete the appropriate form and get approval from your academic School orInstitute, as well as approval from the other college.Registry WebsiteTelephone: +44 (0) 20 7882 5005Module Registration form", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3530, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74ea5b73-5bde-428b-abe0-8cf9a2d2ef58": {"__data__": {"id_": "74ea5b73-5bde-428b-abe0-8cf9a2d2ef58", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "07d4a90b-7d52-4b01-bda6-d84e947303ef", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "hash": "d0774d0e94e9705e0dd862e7b7f30dceaf3bc1aec3170184f0344b54b1817026", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "18/01/2024, 2:46\u202fpmEECS Student Handbook 2023/24 | MyQMUL\nPage 58 of 82https://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/mod/book/tool/print/index.php?id=24449717.3 Module RegistrationTo register for your modules you will log-in to MySIS (your personal area of SIS) with your usual computer log-in, and make preliminary choices from a list usingthe descriptions to tell you what the modules are about.

During lectures, the lecturer presents material to thewhole class, usually using teaching aids such as data projectors, white-boards, videos and computer demonstrations. Lecturers have individual styles ofteaching: some may o!er lecture slides or notes (handed out in the lecture, downloadable from the module website or available from reception for a small fee tocover printing costs), while others will expect students to take all their own notes, or to supplement supplied notes with their own additions. Students should re-read their lecture notes, where possible, before the next lecture, so that they can ask any questions or clarification before the next set ofmaterial is handed out. It is worth remembering that notes will be the basis of revision for exams, so it is wise to put some e!ort into making them as good aspossible.LabsMany modules use weekly laboratory classes (labs) in order to give students practical experience of applying or testing concepts discussed during lectures.Practical skills, e.g. programming, are best developed in this type of environment. Teaching Assistants (typically members of sta! or postgraduate researchstudents) will be on hand to answer questions and help with practical problems. The support sta! will not solve the problem on the student\u2019s behalf, but will tryto guide them towards finding a solution themselves. Set tasks are usually assigned in advance, and students should look at them before the class, if possible,and identify any problems, so that they can ask about these during the lab. A module will o\"en have several time-slots set aside for labs, and each student will be assigned to a lab group, which has an individual time-slot. Labs are usuallyrun in a particular section of the Temporary uilding, depending on the level of the module and the number of students. Lab groups and time-slots for individualmodules are usually available on your EECS landing page under quick links. If a student wishes to change lab groups or time-slots, s/he must have good reason,e.g. a timetable clash. Changes cannot be made for other, more minor reasons; it is the student\u2019s responsibility to be available during timetabled hours in term-time.Modules that involve hardware also usually have several laboratory sessions as part of the module. The schedule for your laboratory sessions will be available onyour EECS landing page. It is important that you prepare for the laboratory sessions in advance of the session. Tutorial Exercise classesLike labs, some modules use exercise classes in order to give students practical experience of applying concepts discussed during lectures. Classes are usuallyheld in a seminar room, and are o\"en based on pen-and-paper tasks. Teaching Assistants (typically members of sta! or postgraduate research students) will beon hand to answer questions and check solutions. The Teaching Assistants will not solve the problem on the student\u2019s behalf, but will try to guide them towardsfinding a solution themselves. Set tasks are usually assigned in advance, and students should look at them before the class, if possible, and identify anyproblems, so that they can ask about these during the exercise class. Students should attempt to complete the tasks while help is at hand; if the work cannot befinished in the timetabled exercise class slot, students may finish it in their own time (but without the help of teaching Assistants).A module will o\"en have several time-slots set aside for exercise classes, and each student will be assigned to a group, which has an individual time-slot. Exerciseclasses are o\"en run in the Temporary building, or in small seminar or lecture rooms elsewhere in the College. Groups and time-slots for individual modules areusually posted on your landing page or QM Plus. If a student wishes to change groups or time-slots, s/he must have good reason, e.g. a timetable clash. Changescannot be made for other, more minor reasons; it is the student\u2019s responsibility to be available during timetabled hours in term-time.Project meetings (second, third and final year, and Masters students)Some second, third, final year and Masters modules are project-based (e.g. group projects and the final year project).

This statement describes how Turnitin is used within the school andthe data it creates about your work. 1           How Turnitin works 1.1          A Turnitin assignment is set up by a member of sta!, either on QMplus or directly on Turnitin\u2019s own website. You then access this assignment online andupload your work before the due date.  Turnitin will analyse the submitted work to identify text matches with other sources and will compare the work against:the current and archived web; previously submitted work; books and journals.1.2          For each piece of submitted work Turnitin provides two things:A similarity index, which indicates the percentage of the submitted paper that Turnitin has identified as matching other sources.An originality report, which shows each of these matches in more detail, including the source(s) that Turnitin has found. 2           How Turnitin is used within the school 2.1           Turnitin is used on the majority of undergraduate and post-graduate assignments that contribute towards your final grade.  Turnitin will not normally beused on the following assignments:\u00a7  short assignments (under 500 words)\u00a7  contributions to online discussions\u00a7  exercises submitted on paper\u00a7  exams\u00a7  computer programs2.2          For those assignments where Turnitin is used, all submissions to that assignment will be submitted to Turnitin.2.3          How we use the information provided by Turnitin2.3.1         Only academic sta! will make a judgement on whether plagiarism has occurred in a piece of work.  An academic may interpret the originality report tohelp but Turnitin itself does not make this judgement.2.3.2         We do not use a threshold percentage to identify whether plagiarism has occurred and may review any originality report in detail.2.3.3         Turnitin will highlight matching text such as references, quotations, common phrases and data tables within work that has no plagiarism issues at all. Those interpreting Turnitin reports will discount such matches and so initial percentages are o\"en irrelevant.2.3.4         Where it is suspected that plagiarism has occurred in a piece of work, the originality report may be submitted to the Head of School and possibly to anAssessment O!ences Panel for further investigation. 2.4          How you can use the information provided by Turnitin", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2669, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e63a2f02-b59a-4597-8274-a6678172f046": {"__data__": {"id_": "e63a2f02-b59a-4597-8274-a6678172f046", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24ff08dd-679c-47fa-b70e-b3487c975e54", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_path": "/home/mehdi/Downloads/implementation/data/TAIBEECS/EECS Student Handbook 2023_24 _ MyQMUL.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1075085, "creation_date": "2024-09-07", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-30"}, "hash": "0b913774eb9b3c152a80290321bd9cfdbe9e6cd67cf621d43057cde93731985d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "18/01/2024, 2:46\u202fpmEECS Student Handbook 2023/24 | MyQMUL\nPage 63 of 82https://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/mod/book/tool/print/index.php?id=24449712.4.1         There will be an opportunity for you to see a Turnitin report on your work before Turnitin is used on your assessed work.  You will be informed of theQM+ assignments using Turnitin.  Turnitin use is module and assignment dependent.2.4.2         No other student will be able to see an originality report on your work.2.4.3         To help you understand what the report is telling you, please ensure you have followed the guidance on the E-Learning Unit\u2019s website(http://www.elearning.capd.qmul.ac.uk/guide/interpreting-your-originality-report/).2.4.4         Where assessments allow a Turnitin submission prior to final submission you may find it helpful to resubmit your work a\"er reviewing the originalityreport and you will generally be given one opportunity to do this.  Where this is the case, the idea is to use the report to help you identify any potential issues youmay not have spotted before, and not to change individual words to avoid a match.  Be aware of the referencing and plagiarism guidance available on page 35.2.4.5         If you have a question about your originality report that is not answered by the material linked to in 2.4.3 above, please direct these to your moduleorganiser in the first instance. 2.5          Other things you should know2.5.1         Turnitin stores a copy of most work submitted to it in its repository.  This does not a!ect the ownership of or any copyright in the original work.2.5.2         Sta! may configure a Turnitin assignment such that copies of submissions are not stored in its database.  This will be done for all test-runs or any\u2018dummy\u2019 assignments used for training or demonstration purposes.2.5.3         Sta! on your course will ensure that no commercially or otherwise sensitive documents are stored in Turnitin\u2019s repository. You cannot opt out of having your work scanned by Turnitin, but if you believe that your work should be deleted a\"er it is scanned you should contact yourlecturer.HOW TO REFERENCE YOUR WORKDetails of how to reference the material that you have used in assessed coursework are available from our Key Skills web page.  You should make sure that youare familiar with all the advice contained here especially if you are submitting written work for the first time. (http://www.library.qmul.ac.uk/referencing)PROCEDURES FOR SUSPECTED PLAGIARISMIf plagiarism is suspected in an item of assessed coursework worth 30% or less of the overall course mark, then the work will be subject to a Schoolinvestigation.  Students will be invited to comment on any allegations of plagiarism.  Penalties that can be imposed range from a formal warning to failure in thecoursework element without any opportunity to re-submit. PROCEDURES FOR SUSPECTED PLAGIARISM \u2013 MAJOR ITEMS OF ASSESSED COURSEWORKA major item of assessed coursework is one that is worth more than 25% of the total course mark.  This includes your project report.  If plagiarism is suspectedin a major piece of coursework, then the case will be referred by the School directly to the Academic Secretary who in turn will bring it to the attention of theChair of the Examination O!ences panel.

Students have a responsibility towards College and towards their funding body, where relevant, todisplay the same effort and commitment as they would towards an employer. Any student who consistently spends less than this amount of time on theirstudies can expect to experience problems.Students must be free to attend classes between the hours of 9.00 am and 6.00 pm Mondays to Fridays during term-time. Attendance at ALL classes iscompulsory, and will be formally monitored by a variety of means. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to ensure that any absence is explained, in advance wherepossible, to the relevant sta! and to their adviser, and that any necessary forms and supporting documentation are submitted. The consequences of any failureto do so may be serious, and may include deregistration from College and notification of deregistration to grant-awarding Local Education Authorities (LEAs) orthe Student Loans Company (SLC). This may lead to the LEA or SLC ceasing payment and requiring some, if not all, of any grant to be repaid.If absence a!ects a substantial period of time, especially submission of assessed coursework or attendance at in-term tests or end-of-year examinations, thestudent must ensure that an appropriate Extenuating Circumstances Form is submitted together with supporting documents, alternatively Interruption ofStudies should be considered in extreme circumstances.

This is important both in the context of taught classes (e.g.labs and tutorials), where students need to make the best possible use of the dedicated time and resources available to them, and of private study time. Students are advised to taketime management seriously right from the beginning of their studies; failure to do so will make it much more difficult to catch up at a later date. When planning study time, students should take into account extra-curricular activities and any part-time employment they hold. It is now very common forstudents to hold a part- time job for financial reasons while studying. However, it should be remembered that this is the equivalent of holding down both a full-time and an additional part-time job. Students must balance the demands of their studies, which are paramount, with their financial needs; while students arenot prohibited from part-time employment, this should never interfere with attendance at scheduled classes or the allocation of su!icient private study time.Part- time employment will not be accepted as a valid excuse for missing compulsory classes or any assessed coursework, tests or examinations. Studentsshould also be aware that working anti-social hours, e.g. late nights, can interfere with concentration and study performance.

Sometimes, though, emotional and psychological issues canbecome too challenging, and may have a negative e!ect on your studies and well-being. Our Counsellors can help you to make sense of di!icult experiences andfeelings by providing the opportunity to think and talk reflectively, which can bring relief and meaningful changes.The first step is meeting confidentially with one of our Counsellors to discuss what type of support might be most useful to you.

For manystudents, just one or two sessions can really help. Our Counsellors are all highly experienced in working with students, and all types of issues.
