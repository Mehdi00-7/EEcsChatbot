Whilst we encourage you to go through each course from start to finish in one seating, we do understand that priority tasks may intervene. As such, each course can be paused allowing you to complete it when the interruption is over.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Is there a deadline for completing the course(s)?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Yes there is. You should complete the training 30 days after receipts of the course email notification. If you do not complete by this date, you will receive email reminders from your schools, departments and institutes to remind you to complete the training.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>The video display screen is too small for me. What should I do?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Our partners have designed each clip to launch in a pop-up style window \u2013 much as you would get if using YouTube. You can always enlarge the window to full screen mode by hovering your mouse over the video screen to reveal the full screen symbol . Clicking this symbol will enlarge the screen and give you a better experience on your device.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Do I get notified when I have completed the course?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Each clip must run down the clock to register as complete. Some clips have a little time lag of a few seconds between the last action and the end of the clock. We recommended that you wait until the clock has run down before moving on to the next clip. This also applies to the thank you message we added to the end of each course. If for whatever reason a clip did not run down its time, that course would not register for you as completed.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Can I replay/rewind the clip?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Yes! As the clip rolls along, a long horizontal bar appears near the bottom of the clip. To replay a previous section, you can hover your mouse over the clip to reveal a hand icon . Use this icon to hold and drag back the horizontal line to where you want to return. Release the hold, and the clip will continue from the point of release.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Why am I not shown the correct answers on the interactions?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Our partners have designed the interactions as practice rather than tests. As such, they highlight best practice and observations. By paying careful attention to the preceding clip, all the information for participation in the interaction would have been explained. You can always replay an interaction if still in doubt.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Is there a certificate for completing the course?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Yes there is.

If you get an MFA prompt you were not expecting (you\u2019re not logging in to any of the protected services at that time) DO NOT APPROVE IT. If it happens repeatedly, please contact Service Desk providing approximate time when you received the prompt.

On iOS: Apple mail on iOS 11 and newer, Outlook Mobile App. On Android: native Google client, Outlook Mobile, BlueMail apps. In general, any email client supporting Modern Authentication (OAUTH2) protocols will work with MFA. We recommend using Outlook for best compatibility with all Office 365 features.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What are the minimum supported versions of iOS and Android?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>iOS 11 and newer and Android version 6 and newer.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>We use local applications and scripts to send bulk emails to students and staff.

What should I do?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>There are multiple alternatives available: We could issue a hardware token. It can be used in parallel with the phone when the signal is available. Also, the Authenticator App generates codes every 60 sec, just like the hardware token does, without the requirement for mobile service or internet connection.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Will students or staff have to attend campus to resolve any MFA issues?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>We have a well-staffed service desk available to help you remotely in resolving MFA issues as they arise.

I understand that we can choose between Mac and PC, but there are several possible hardware configurations for either.. and some might need better specs than others depending on the nature of the work.</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Yes, ITS do have 4 specification options for laptops. However any non-standard requests, FRMs and ITS Research Consultants will assist/advice. FYI\u2026 a checklist approval/ Business case may be required and this will go through an approval process.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Some researchers may have agreements that allow them to individually access and store data, but this agreement may be violated if ITS (or anyone else) has access to the data stored in computer. How does ITS would deal with this?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>All QM staff are required to complete the mandatory training for Cyber Security and Data Protection (GDPR). All basic, personal data are regarded confidential and access will require consent from the user/owner and approval from HR in some cases. Under these requirements a managed device would be highly recommended as this gives you the added security of wiping the data remotely in the event of a theft or loss of the device. The data also belongs to QM\u2026 hence it would be QMs remit and best interest to protect the data. This is one of the main objectives of the managed service rollout. However, either way we must comply to the terms and conditions of the research agreement\u2026 again ITS Research Consultant will assist/advice in this best tools and equipment to meet your research needs.</p>\n</div>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\"><a href=\"#top\" title=\"Use alt + click to follow the link\">back to top</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">\u00a0</p>\n<h2><a id=\"SharePointOneDrive\"></a>\u00a0SharePoint</h2>\n<div id=\"accordion\">\n<h3>When should I use SharePoint, and when OneDrive?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>\"OneDrive is for personal use.

Unfortunately, using distribution and group lists is not supported\u2026 yet!</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How do you use Teams with external guests?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>The simplest and easiest way (for other parties) to chat / speak / see / collaborate with you is through a Teams meeting. Teams meetings can be scheduled through Outlook as though you were scheduling a \u201cnormal\u201d meeting (click the Teams button when you create the meeting invite \u2013 this button appears in the desktop version of Outlook once you have the Teams application installed on your computer). They can also be scheduled through Outlook on the Web or Outlook Mobile, and through the calendar in the Teams app itself.</p>\n<p>When you schedule a Teams meeting with an individual or a group of people, the recipients of the calendar invite will see a clickable Teams Meeting link in the invitation. When they click the Teams Meeting link they can either join through the Teams application (if they have installed it) or through a modern web browser.</p>\n<p>The individuals you invite don\u2019t need to be Teams users \u2013 anyone can join a Teams meeting \u2013 this makes it the easiest and most reliable method of collaborating with externals as with other methods (noted below) the outcome partly depends on the setup outside of QM i.e. the other user\u2019s organisation, which QM cannot control.</p>\n<p><strong>Other Options</strong></p>\n<p>The limitation of Teams Meetings is that your collaboration opportunities are confined to meetings, as opposed to being ad hoc and asynchronous. You don\u2019t see presence information for those individuals outside of the meeting, and they don\u2019t have access to the resources of any Teams which you have set up. Sometimes this is desirable and appropriate, but not always, in which case there are further options to collaborate externally and to \u201cbring people in\u201d to a fuller Teams experience. The main issue with the other options is that each can be frustrated by restrictions/limitations which may have been placed on access by the IT provider of the 3rd party. Our suggestion is to \u201cjust try them\u201d and see what happens, but there can be no guarantees that the external user is able to communicate / collaborate outside of a Teams Meeting. This means it\u2019s unrealistic to expect Teams to replace email altogether, though hopefully you will drastically cut down your use of email.</p>\n<p>In addition to meetings, Microsoft Teams gives you two different ways to communicate and collaborate with people outside your organization.</p>\n<p>The first \u2013 external access \u2013 lets you find, call, and chat with users in other organisations (for example UCL \u2013 people with email address format of ucl.ac.uk). The second \u2013 guest access \u2013 lets you add individuals to your teams, as guests, using their email address. You can collaborate with guests as you would with any other users in your organization (within a Team/channel, once they are added to your Team).</p>\n<p>You can use both external access and guest access if you want - one does not preclude the other.</p>\n<p>At a high level, here\u2019s how to choose (for a detailed comparison, see the table at the end of this article)</p>\n<p><strong>External Access</strong></p>\n<p>Use external access when you need a solution that lets external users in other domains find, call, chat, and set up meetings with you. External users have no access to your organization's teams or team resources. Choose external access when you want to communicate with external users who are still on Skype for Business or Skype.</p>\n<p>There are some limitations to external access and the outcome partly depends on whether the other organisation is using Teams and any limitations their IT Dept have placed on external access from their end. QM has no restrictions and allows external access with any organisation. If you\u2019re unable to reach the other party using external access, you try Guest access or you can just invite them to a Teams meeting.</p>\n<p>In order to start an interaction with external access, click the \u201cNew chat\u201d icon to the left of the search bar at the top of teams. Paste in the email address of the user and hit enter. You may (depending on how they\u2019re set up) be able to send them a message and see their presence. Assuming this works you should also be able to call them.</p>\n<p>Currently QMUL is in transition from using Skype as default communication tool in Office 365, to using Teams.

However, downloading the ap gives you all the most useful features - background effects, multiple people tiled on the screen etc.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>If I create a team, can I invite someone to the meeting without me being present?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Yes, just set up the meeting in the channel, and then you don't need to join</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How do you know if your guest has accepted your invitation? Can people join without an invite?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>In the case of a meeting invite - you can see this in your calendar assuming the recipient responded to the meeting invite - a Teams meeting is really just a calendar meeting. In the case of inviting a guest as a member of your team, you don't currently receive confirmation that they accepted your invitation though you could ask them to post a message to the team confirming they have access. Anyone can be invited, but in order to join, you need the meeting link</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Can you add a whole group of students to this?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Yes! Class Teams are a great way to work with students</p>\n</div>\n<h3>If I schedule a regular Teams meeting does this automatically call all in a Team at that time? If so, what happens if one of the meetings fall\u00a0on a day when one member of team is on leave?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>When you schedule a teams meeting in a channel, it will initiate the meeting at the time scheduled and prompt people to join, but not actively call them</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Do\u00a0meetings you add to your Teams calendar sync with Outlook?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>Yes, they do and vice versa</p>\n</div>\n<h3>How do I switch on captions and personalise or blur the background photo?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>In a call, tap the three dots on the Teams calling bar, then chose switch on captions or show background effects. You need the desktop version for this</p>\n</div>\n<h3>What is the lobby?</h3>\n<div>\n<p>The lobby is a waiting room. You can use it with external participants to have them wait while you meet internal collagues and then let them in when you are ready, for example.

When editing or viewing, the connection and the content is secure and encrypted. Sharing externally from Teams is possible but you need to open the team file store in SharePoint and share from there. There is the option to block download and only allow viewing. File storage is very secure as it is based in SharePoint, stored in the UK in Microsoft's secure datacentres, backed up in Europe.
