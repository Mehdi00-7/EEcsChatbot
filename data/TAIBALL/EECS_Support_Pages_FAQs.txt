If you would rather manage your own machine we give you an entry in our DHCP server so your machine gets an IP address on the “self managed” network and that’s pretty much it.  This setup gives you great flexibility but please note:</p>
<ul>
<li>For security reasons there is no access to any file servers on that network so you don’t have direct access to your home directory or the /import drives.</li>
<li>Likewise there is no remote access to machines on that network. The incoming firewall is <em>very</em> restrictive.</li>
<li>All data backup is entirely your responsibility, unlike managed machines we don’t copy your home dir to tape daily.</li>
<li>It’s not currently possible to run software that needs to communicate with EECS licence servers on self-managed machines.</li>
<li>We don’t have the resources to help you install machines on the self-managed network – Google is (hopefully) your friend.</li>

<p>For example, if you want to access the grunt-server ‘london’ from home, you must SSH into the research ‘login server’ first, and then ‘hop’ onto ‘london’.</p>

We are looking at fixing this issue soon. Meanwhile, if you are locked out of your account due to VMware or any other unforseen circumstance, its likely you are worried about your work.</p>
<p>Just to be sure to not lose your data at any point:</p>
<ul>
<li> Backup your work regularly.</li>
<li>Save all files/documents in your home directory only. All files saved in your home directory will be synced automatically. Its good practice and always recommended to save all your work in your home directory as opposed to saving it in Desktop/Documents.</li>

Your Profile will stop syncing if quota is exceeded. To prevent exceeding your profile quota limit, make sure to move files to your home directory instead of just leaving it around in Desktop or Downloads or elsewhere. Read on for what you can do if your profile quota has exceeded.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><em> If you’ve exceeded your file server storage space, then you’d have to contact ITL helpdesk or systems office at CS327 for fixes. But before that, read here about <a href="http://support.eecs.qmul.ac.uk//computing-facilities/login-problems/">Login/Profile</a> problems. </em></p>
<p><strong>Fix profile quota excess:</strong></p>
<p>Users have seperate space allocated for Windows profiles which has limited space. Please note that this is completely separate from your home directory (H drive). You will need to move or delete large files from your profile. Usually most of these will be in the Desktop or Downloads folders. You can easily find where the largest files are in your profile by clicking on the red cross in the bottom right taskbar icon. If you have exceeded your profile quota you will get the following message below, roughly every 5-10 minutes.</p>
<p><img alt="profilespace.png" height="471" src="http://services.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/files/5213/9230/1259/profilespace.png" width="548"/></p>
<p>You will see a window with a list of files ordered largest first. You should move or delete these files.</p>
<p><img alt="profilespace-filelist.png" height="404" src="http://services.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/files/1013/9230/8690/profilespace-filelist.png" width="448"/></p>
<p>The red cross should then change to a blue screen icon showing available free space, as below. You can now log off and your files will be synced with the server copy of the profile.</p>
<p><img alt="profilespace-blueicon.png" height="309" src="http://services.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/files/4613/9230/1896/profilespace-blueicon.png" width="368"/></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: If you log off before freeing space your profile will not be synced with the server copy and will stay on that machine</strong></p>

<p>In the ITL, print jobs issued from the school machines are served by the release stations in different floors. Go to the release station adjoining the printer to which you issued the print job, and swipe your id card. Should you have sufficient print balance left on your card, you’ll be presented with an option to release your print job to the printing queue. Once this is done, please wait for a few minutes to collect the print outs (more so, if you tried printing a lengthy document).</p>
<p>As a general suggestion, before issuing any bulk print job, we recommend starting off with a few pages to check if printing works fine.</p>
<p>If none of the above solutions work for you, please contact ITL helpdesk (middle floor ITL) for support.</p>

<p>1. Unstable eduroam connection. You need to be logged in to eduroam using your eecs credentials to avail remote printing srevices. But sometimes, when there is an unstable eduroam connection, remote printing may not work. If this is the case, we recommend trying to print after eduroam becomes stable. </p>
<p>2. Insufficient print balance. Your eecs account doesn’t have sufficient print balance (you’ll most likely be notified of this in the print release stations).

How can i clear some space?</div><div class="arconix-faq-content faq-closed"><p>The following instructions are Linux-based commands, which you can use either on an EECS Linux Desktop/Server or on a ‘<a href="http://support.eecs.qmul.ac.uk//faq/what-is-a-login-server/">login server</a>‘.</p>
<h3>Disk quota</h3>
<p>In Linux, you can use the <code>quota</code> command to display your current quota usage:</p>
<pre>[-bash-4.1]$ quota -s
Disk quotas for user jdoe123 (uid 012345):
     Filesystem   space   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
stilton:          <strong>4500M</strong>*  <strong>4000M</strong>    <strong>5000M</strong>   30      <strong>215k</strong>    0       0 
/export/user10
</pre>
<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;">Here’s a quick explanation of these numbers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>space</strong>*: Your home directory is currently 4,4GB big. The asterisk <code>*</code> next to it means that you are exceeding the allocated ‘soft limit’ for your user, which is explained next.</li>
<li><strong>quota</strong>:  This is the ‘soft limit’ for your user. If you have exceeded that limit, you must clear some files from your home directory before the ‘grace period’ expires.</li>
<li><strong>limit</strong>: This is the ‘hard limit’. If you exceed that limit, you will not be able to create any new files. This will lead to a situation where you will not be able to log into a Linux desktop.</li>
<li><strong>grace</strong>: The grace period, before the end of which you must clear some files from your home directory, if you have exceeded your ‘soft limit’.</li>
<li><strong>files</strong>: The number of the files in your home directory.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Disk usage</h3>
<p>You can use the linux command <code>du</code> (Disk Usage) is very handy for tracking down files that consume large amounts of space in your home directory. Each user group (Students — UGs/PGs and Staff/PhD) have different allowances for disk quota.</p>
<p>To list the total disk usage in a human readable-format (i.e., size specified in K/MB etc.), type ‘du -sh’ :</p>

Why?</div><div class="arconix-faq-content faq-closed"><p>The error occurs if a header file is not present in the standard include file directories used by <code>gcc/g++/nvcc etc.</code> A similar problem can occur for libraries:</p>
<pre class="example">/usr/bin/ld: cannot find <var>library</var>
</pre>
<p>This happens if a library used for linking is not present in the standard library directories.</p>
<p>By default, <code>gcc</code> based compilers search the following directories for header files:</p>
<pre class="example">/usr/local/include/
/usr/include/
</pre>
<p>and the following directories for libraries:</p>
<pre class="example">/usr/local/lib/
/usr/lib/
</pre>
<p>The list of directories for header files is often referred to as the <em>include path</em>, and the list of directories for libraries as the <em>library search path</em> or <em>link path</em>.</p>
<p>The directories on these paths are searched in order, from first to last in the two lists above. For example, a header file found in <tt>‘/usr/local/include’</tt> takes precedence over a file with the same name in <tt>‘/usr/include’</tt>. Similarly, a library found in <tt>‘/usr/local/lib’</tt> takes precedence over a library with the same name in <tt>‘/usr/lib’</tt>.</p>
<p>When additional libraries are installed in other directories it is necessary to extend the search paths, in order for the libraries to be found. The compiler options <code>-I</code> and <code>-L</code> add new directories to the beginning of the include path and library search path respectively.</p>
<p>For example compiling the “test.cc” code below:</p>
<pre>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include "cuda_runtime.h"
int main(void)
{
  int num_elements = 16;
  int num_bytes = num_elements * sizeof(int);

  int *device_array = 0;
  int *host_array = 0;

  host_array = (int*)malloc(num_bytes);
  cudaMalloc((void**)&amp;device_array, num_bytes);
  cudaMemset(device_array, 0, num_bytes);
  cudaMemcpy(host_array, device_array, num_bytes, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; num_elements; ++i)
    printf("%d", host_array[i]);
  free(host_array);
  cudaFree(device_array);
  return 0;
}
</pre>
<p> </p>
<p>With “nvcc test.cc -o testcode” will produce:</p>
<p>test.cc:3:26: error: cuda_runtime.h: No such file or directory<br/>
test.cc: In function ‘int main()’:<br/>
test.cc:13: error: ‘cudaMalloc’ was not declared in this scope<br/>
test.cc:14: error: ‘cudaMemset’ was not declared in this scope<br/>
test.cc:15: error: ‘cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost’ was not declared in this scope<br/>
test.cc:15: error: ‘cudaMemcpy’ was not declared in this scope<br/>
test.cc:19: error: ‘cudaFree’ was not declared in this scope</p>
<p>With “nvcc test.cc -I/usr/local/cuda-5.5/include -o test” will produce:</p>
<p>/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcudart_static<br/>
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status</p>
<p>With “nvcc test.cc -I/usr/local/cuda/include -L/usr/local/cuda/targets/x86_64/lib -o test”<br/>

6. Copy the newly generated public key to the intended remote host using the following command:<br/>
<strong>ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub remote-host</strong><br/>
In the command, remote-host is the servername of the remote host you’d like to access. E.g., bert.student.eecs.qmul.ac.uk (for students) or frank.eecs.qmul.ac.uk (for staff/PhD)<br/>
7. Enter password for logging into the remote host<br/>
8. Your computer (i.e., local host) will now be identified as a trusted source in the remote host. Going forward, you can login to the remote host by typing <strong>ssh remote-host</strong> in terminal, followed by providing your passphrase</p>
