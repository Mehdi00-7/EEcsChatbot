<h3>What IT equipment will I need for my studies?</h3>
<div>
<p>To access all the support and learning technologies that are available we recommend that you have the following equipment:</p>
<ul>
<li>A laptop or desktop PC with a camera, microphone, internet access. The computer you use does not usually need to be a high specification, but should comfortably run IOS or Windows10. If your computer was new within the last 4-5 years, it should enable you to access the primary applications applications such as the Microsoft Office Suite - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58FIAelSoO4">see videoI get the error message</a></li>
<li>A laptop is recommended as laptops are better enabled for completion of assignments and engagement in the digital learning environments.  Laptops also enable learning from home, on campus and during travel to and from campus.</li>
<li>A reasonably fast and reliable internet connection is required to participate in online tutorials and lectures.  If your internet connection at home is not very good consider whether you can use an internet connection somewhere else (for example a workplace, library or friend’s house dependent on the Government’s latest guidance) when you need to study online or join an online tutorial. If you are moving into new accommodation don’t forget to ask about the availability of wifi.</li>
<li>A headset or earphones with a microphone. To more fully participate in online tutorials, you’ll need a headset with a microphone. You might be able to use a built-in microphone if your computer has one, but you’ll be able to hear, and be heard, more clearly with a headset.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="eduroam">Eduroam</h2>
<div id="accordion7">
<h3>What is eduroam?</h3>
<div>
<p>At Queen Mary University of London we use a service provided by Janet to allow our users to connect to the College network. Janet is the UK provider for eduroam. “<em>eduroam (education roaming) is the secure, world-wide roaming access service developed for the international research and education community</em>.” (Source: https://www.eduroam.org/).

<p>The wifi service in the main Dentistry building at Whitechapel is provided by the NHS Trust – not QMUL.</p>
<p>The Trust broadcast the Eduroam network but do not offer QM-Guest or QM-Events.</p>
<p>As a result, we cannot provide visitors/guests with wifi in that building – unless they are registered to Eduroam in their own institutions.</p>

<h2 id="mail">Mailing list / Shared mailbox</h2>
<div id="accordion10">
<h3>What are the differences between a mailing list and a shared mailbox?</h3>
<div>
<p>A mailing list, often referred to with the shorthand "list," is a means of sending electronic mail to many different addresses at once. The sender does not need to know the addresses of everyone on the list in order to ensure that the mail gets to all of them.</p>
<p>A shared mailbox can be used to allow multiple users read and write access to the same mailbox. Unlike mailing lists, shared mailboxes appear on the Global Address Book.</p>
</div>
<h3>I’m not getting the "All Staff" emails, what do I do?</h3>
<div>
<p>If you are a new member of staff and are missing the “All staff” emails you will need to contact your Directory Administrator. You will need to ask them to add you onto the Staff Directory, once this has happened you will start receiving the “All Staff” emails.</p>
<p>You can find your Directory Administrator on the Staff Directory, there is a link at the bottom of the page to view the respective department’s Directory Administrator.</p>

<div id="accordion11">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div>
<p>As we move towards new ways of working, and to improve on our regulatory compliance posture, Queen Mary introduced these training packs to bolster and improve awareness on issues around Cyber Security and GDPR. In the main, the instructions are easy to follow, but these FAQs represent an additional resource in the event you need a little more help completing or gaining the benefits of completing the course(s).</p>
</div>
<h3>How do I start a course?</h3>
<div>
<p>You will receive an email notification – one for each course. This email contains a safe link to our Queen Mary content on the MetaCompliance platform. Clicking on the link takes you to your home page where you can access the course in the ‘My Learning’ section. This happens for each course.</p>
</div>
<h3>How long are the courses?</h3>
<div>
<p>Each training programme takes up roughly 30 minutes of your day, with a few minutes added for educative interactions built into each course. Whilst we encourage you to go through each course from start to finish in one seating, we do understand that priority tasks may intervene. As such, each course can be paused allowing you to complete it when the interruption is over.</p>
</div>
<h3>Is there a deadline for completing the course(s)?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes there is. You should complete the training 30 days after receipts of the course email notification. If you do not complete by this date, you will receive email reminders from your schools, departments and institutes to remind you to complete the training.</p>
</div>
<h3>The video display screen is too small for me. What should I do?</h3>
<div>
<p>Our partners have designed each clip to launch in a pop-up style window – much as you would get if using YouTube. You can always enlarge the window to full screen mode by hovering your mouse over the video screen to reveal the full screen symbol . Clicking this symbol will enlarge the screen and give you a better experience on your device.</p>
</div>
<h3>Do I get notified when I have completed the course?</h3>
<div>
<p>Each clip must run down the clock to register as complete. Some clips have a little time lag of a few seconds between the last action and the end of the clock. We recommended that you wait until the clock has run down before moving on to the next clip. This also applies to the thank you message we added to the end of each course. If for whatever reason a clip did not run down its time, that course would not register for you as completed.</p>
</div>
<h3>Can I replay/rewind the clip?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes! As the clip rolls along, a long horizontal bar appears near the bottom of the clip. To replay a previous section, you can hover your mouse over the clip to reveal a hand icon . Use this icon to hold and drag back the horizontal line to where you want to return. Release the hold, and the clip will continue from the point of release.</p>
</div>
<h3>Why am I not shown the correct answers on the interactions?</h3>
<div>
<p>Our partners have designed the interactions as practice rather than tests. As such, they highlight best practice and observations. By paying careful attention to the preceding clip, all the information for participation in the interaction would have been explained. You can always replay an interaction if still in doubt.</p>
</div>
<h3>Is there a certificate for completing the course?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes there is. Our partners have provided each participant with a Certificate of Completion to evidence participation in the training. The option to download your certificate should appear at the end of each course. In the event that the option does not appear, you can still printout or download your certificate by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the top right hand side of the page, you will see the ‘person’ icon. Click this</li>
<li>On the dropdown menu, click ’View profile’</li>
<li>Scroll down to ‘My Training’</li>
<li>Click the ‘+’ button on the right side</li>
<li>Under the Courses tab, you’ll find ‘Your completed courses</li>
<li>Next to the Course title is the certificate button (with the trophy icon)</li>
<li>Click the trophy icon</li>
<li>Certificate opens in a new PDF window</li>
<li>Click anywhere on that page and the option to either print or download your certificate will be available to you.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h3>Where can I get further help or make comments?</h3>

<p>You will be prompted for MFA when accessing protected QMUL web apps (Office 365, MyHR, RGMS, Power BI and many other) via a web browser. You get an option to trust your browser for 30 days, before you need to satisfy an MFA prompt again.</p>
</div>
<h3>I’m using a mobile device (iOS / Andriod phone or tablet). What should I expect in terms of MFA?</h3>
<div>
<p>You will be prompted for MFA once every 30 days by both native mobile email clients and Microsoft mobile apps (Outlook mobile, Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint).</p>
</div>
<h3>I’m using an IMAP email client (Thunderbird, etc.). What should I expect in terms of MFA?</h3>
<div>
<p>Nothing will change for the time being. You can continue to use your email without MFA. We will roll out MFA support for IMAP, POP and authenticated SMTP clients as soon as it’s available in the Office 365 environment.</p>
</div>
<h3>I’m using VDI / Apps Anywhere. What should I expect in terms of MFA?</h3>
<div>
<p>You will be prompted for MFA when you open the VDI / Apps Anywhere session. Once you log in, you will not be prompted for MFA while accessing the QMUL protected applications.</p>
</div>
<h3>How do I register for MFA?</h3>
<div>
<p>You can complete a combined registration for MFA and SSPR by visiting <a href="https://sspr.qmul.ac.uk">https://sspr.qmul.ac.uk</a></p>
<p>More information and detailed instructions can be found here: <a href="https://www.its.qmul.ac.uk/support/self-help/multi-factor-authentication">https://www.its.qmul.ac.uk/support/self-help/multi-factor-authentication</a></p>
</div>
<h3>How do I change my preferred method for MFA?</h3>
<div>
<p>You can change your preferred MFA method by revisiting <a href="https://sspr.qmul.ac.uk">https://sspr.qmul.ac.uk</a></p>
</div>
<h3>What methods for MFA authentication are available?</h3>
<div>
<p>You can use the following methods as your MFA response: · Push notification to the Authenticator app on your mobile phone · One time code sent in a text/SMS message to your mobile phone · Automated voice call to your mobile phone · Automated voice call to a landline phone · In exceptional circumstances, you can request a hardware token to be issued to you. It will generate new One Time Passcodes every 30 or 60 seconds.</p>
</div>
<h3>I no longer have the phone which I used for MFA. How can I get into my account?</h3>
<div>
<p>Please contact the Service Desk. We will verify your identity and help you register a new phone as your MFA token.</p>
</div>
<h3>Can I have more than one phone registered as my MFA token?</h3>
<div>
<p>You can have one mobile and one landline number registered for the voice and text/SMS based MFA methods. You can have up to 5 Authenticator Apps (on mobile phones or tablets) associated with your account for push notification or One Time Passcode MFA methods.</p>
</div>
<h3>How can I reduce the frequency of MFA prompts on devices I use regularly?</h3>
<div>
<p>Apps like Outlook, Teams, OneDrive will prompt you once every 30 days. We cannot change that. You can also tick the “Don't ask again for 30 days” in a web browser, to trust it for that period of time.</p>
</div>
<h3>I don’t want to use a phone as my MFA token. What are my options?</h3>
<div>
<p>In justified cases, you can be issued with a hardware One Time Passcode token, which will generate new codes every 30 or 60 seconds, which you can use for MFA. Please log a ticket to request it, including your justification. Your department may be charged for the token.</p>
</div>
<h3>Will QMUL buy me a phone to use as my MFA token?</h3>
<div>
<p>We will not provide phones specifically for use as MFA tokens. If there is a business justification for you to have a QMUL issued mobile phone, there is already a process in place to request it. You’re welcome to use that phone as your MFA token.</p>
</div>
<h3>I have specialist accessibility needs and I cannot use a phone or an OTP token due to disability. What are my options?</h3>
<div>
<p>Please contact the Service Desk. We can help.</p>
</div>
<h3>I got an MFA prompt I wasn’t expecting, should I approve it in the Authenticator App?</h3>
<div>
<p>NO! If you get an MFA prompt you were not expecting (you’re not logging in to any of the protected services at that time) DO NOT APPROVE IT. If it happens repeatedly, please contact Service Desk providing approximate time when you received the prompt. We will investigate the logs to see if your password might have been compromised and someone is trying to log in as you.</p>
</div>
<h3>What email clients are supported with MFA?</h3>
<div>
<p>On Windows, Macs and Linux: Outlook 2013 and newer, Apple mail, IMAP clients like Thunderbird. On iOS: Apple mail on iOS 11 and newer, Outlook Mobile App. On Android: native Google client, Outlook Mobile, BlueMail apps. In general, any email client supporting Modern Authentication (OAUTH2) protocols will work with MFA. We recommend using Outlook for best compatibility with all Office 365 features.</p>
</div>
<h3>What are the minimum supported versions of iOS and Android?</h3>
<div>
<p>iOS 11 and newer and Android version 6 and newer.</p>
</div>
<h3>We use local applications and scripts to send bulk emails to students and staff. Will this continue to work?</h3>
<div>
<p>As long as the programmatically generated emails are submitted to our internal email relay smtp.qmul.ac.uk, everything will continue to work as before.</p>
</div>
<h3>I'm overseas and getting charged roaming costs to receive verification calls? What should I do?</h3>
<div>
<p>We recommend switching your preferred method to Multi Factor Authetication (MFA). You can change your preferred MFA method by going back to <a href="https://sspr.qmul.ac.uk">https://sspr.qmul.ac.uk</a></p>
</div>
<h3>My phone number in my MFA registration is incorrect and I can't log in. What should I do?</h3>
<div>
<p>Please contact the IT Service Desk who will be able to help.</p>
</div>
<h3>I'm traveling to places where my mobile phone may have no signal or be blocked by the local service providers. What should I do?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are multiple alternatives available: We could issue a hardware token. It can be used in parallel with the phone when the signal is available. Also, the Authenticator App generates codes every 60 sec, just like the hardware token does, without the requirement for mobile service or internet connection.</p>
</div>
<h3>Will students or staff have to attend campus to resolve any MFA issues?</h3>
<div>
<p>We have a well-staffed service desk available to help you remotely in resolving MFA issues as they arise. We've already successfully enrolled thousands of staff and students.</p>
</div>
<h3>Why are we required to set long and complicated passwords?</h3>
<div>
<p>The requirement for 12 to 20 character long password was introduced to offset the fact that QMUL does not enforce a periodic password change every 3 or 6 months. The password policy will allow for the use of a passphrase or three random words, which are actually easier to remember than a complex 8 character password. This follows as closely as we can, the current best practice and government guidance from the National Cyber Security Centre. The combination with MFA and single sign on for many applications mitigates the risk of many insecure passwords being employed.</p>
</div>
<h3>What happens if I don't complete the MFA registration?</h3>
<div>
<p>If you don't complete the MFA registration ahead of time, you will be required to do it next time you sign into any of the protected applications (Office 365 app, MyHR, RGMS and many more)</p>

<h2 id="requesting" style="text-align: left;">Requesting a Device</h2>
<div id="accordion15">
<h3>Will I need a Business case for a MAC and will it be funded by IT Services?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, if the business case for a Mac is approved, ITS will fund this, if it is a new member of staff and their only device or to replace a damaged device.  If their request is also non-standard i.e. not the model offered in the service catalogue and exceeds the cost of the standard Mac, the difference will need to be paid by the department..</p>
</div>
<h3>If I have had a Mac for 6 years but now need a new device will a Mac replacement be provided?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, if the device is damaged or has reached a certain age, this will be replaced with the current standard device or a like for like basis and require a Checklist form approved by IT Services. </p>
</div>
<h3>Can I keep my laptop when I move roles?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, if you are moving to a new role within QM, this includes secondment posts too.</p>
</div>
<h3>What if a staff member is on long-term / sick leave?</h3>
<div>
<p> The member of staff will keep their device. Staff covering this role will be allocated a pre-owned device.</p>
</div>
<h3>Do I have to return my laptop when I leave QM?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, you must return your laptop to your line manager, who will notify IT Services to collect the the device to redeploy after re-imaging and removing licences.</p>
</div>
<h3>Does PEP Package come with non-standard/self-managed device requests?</h3>
<div>
<p>We don’t provide PEP a with non-standard request. We provide a PEP Bundle with a self-managed device with an approved business case.</p>
</div>
<h3>Will I need to submit two business cases for non-standard self-managed device</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, We ideally need to be aware of both requests, so no purchase is made until both are approved</p>
</div>
<h3>Am I only permitted to have 1 device, even if I have a research grant (with equipment)? What happens if the machine needs to be destroyed at the end of the research? What happens if the device goes with the grant?</h3>
<div>
<p>If a research grant has been allocated to purchase a device and that device can be used for both BAU and the Research project without going against any of the policies, then the centrally deployed device can be returned to IT Services and the research grant purchased device can be used as the sole device for work and research. If however there is a real need to have two separate devices to carry out two separate duties, then under this exceptional circumstances two devices maybe permitted</p>
</div>
<h3>What counts as an additional device (iPad, android tablets, etc.,) as I might not want to take an expensive machine on fieldwork</h3>
<div>
<p>A laptop and Ipad/Tablet will be considered as two devices.</p>
</div>
<h3>What happens if I needs a specific type of machine for research/research software?</h3>
<div>
<p>If a standard device offering is not suitable a business case must be submitted for review and approval to IT Services</p>
</div>
<h3>Do I need a business case for a QM mobile phone?</h3>
<div>
<p>Currently No business case is required.</p>
</div>
<h3>Who will handle purchases of equipment?</h3>
<div>
<p>ITS Business support manages all hardware purchase... and Campus Support will image and deploy</p>
</div>
<h3>Can the machines have specs that are needed for computationally intensive jobs? and who will assist us in tailoring the hardware to such specs (this task is currently performed by DW and I personally do not have the expertise)</h3>
<div>
<p>IT Research consultants can assist</p>
</div>
<h3>Which budgets will the machines come from? Does central ITS have any say in what we can or cannot purchase?</h3>
<div>
<p>ITS will fund PEP for all staff across QM and for PGR students within Faculty of S&amp;E and H&amp;SS</p>
</div>
<h3>Is a Managed device a laptop and a Managed Research Desktop Service (mRDS) a desktop?</h3>
<div>
<p>Both are laptop devices, ‘desktop’ is a computing terminology to mean the ‘desktop/screen/window’ we see when we boot up the laptop… this is virtual. This is not a physical desktop device.</p>
</div>
<h3>Can I have a both a desktop and a laptop? This would be extremely important for colleagues who need a powerful desktop while also allowing them to work from home/while travelling/on sabbatical etc.</h3>
<div>
<p>No, QMUL policy state clearly, QM will fund one device per user – PEP. Our standard PEP are laptop devices. Any desktop requests will be treated as non-standard and a business case will be required. So in this scenario you will need to justify (business case) why you require the powerful desktop. And if the second laptop is required and approved this will need to be funded by the school/institute</p>
</div>
<h3>I am still a bit unclear about the reference to a SEF device image that can be updated regularly. Is this the same as the "applications packager in place to assist with the transition from the “School managed” to “ITS managed” with a 3 day SLA turnaround time"? Does this mean that we can lodge request of software updates/adds on to central ITS via that "SEF device image" and expect that requests will be fulfilled within three days? And would this apply also to mRDS (for the area that we do not manage)?</h3>
<div>
<p>SEF will be converted from ‘SEF device image’ to our QMs ITS image. And now that the project is funding and have recruited a dedicated packaging resource for SEF, this means that you can lodge request of software updates and add on to central ITS managed service and expect that requests be fulfilled within three days.</p>
</div>
<h3>Do we have a choice in the specification of the hardware? I understand that we can choose between Mac and PC, but there are several possible hardware configurations for either.. and some might need better specs than others depending on the nature of the work.</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, ITS do have 4 specification options for laptops. However any non-standard requests, FRMs and ITS Research Consultants will assist/advice. FYI… a checklist approval/ Business case may be required and this will go through an approval process.</p>
</div>
<h3>Some researchers may have agreements that allow them to individually access and store data, but this agreement may be violated if ITS (or anyone else) has access to the data stored in computer. How does ITS would deal with this?</h3>
<div>
<p>All QM staff are required to complete the mandatory training for Cyber Security and Data Protection (GDPR). All basic, personal data are regarded confidential and access will require consent from the user/owner and approval from HR in some cases. Under these requirements a managed device would be highly recommended as this gives you the added security of wiping the data remotely in the event of a theft or loss of the device. The data also belongs to QM… hence it would be QMs remit and best interest to protect the data. This is one of the main objectives of the managed service rollout. However, either way we must comply to the terms and conditions of the research agreement… again ITS Research Consultant will assist/advice in this best tools and equipment to meet your research needs.</p>

</div>
<h3>Is Two Factor Authentication available for SharePoint?</h3>
<div>
<p>Two Factor Authentication is an enhanced security process by which the username/password to sign in is augmented with another confirmation to authenticate the user.

<h3>How do I use the channel feature to set up a meeting?</h3>
<div>
<p>Meeting in channels is great to keep everything together for teams of people. To schedule a meeting in a channel, make sure that everyone you want to invite to the meeting is in the team. Unfortunately, using distribution and group lists is not supported… yet!</p>
</div>
<h3>How do you use Teams with external guests?</h3>
<div>
<p>The simplest and easiest way (for other parties) to chat / speak / see / collaborate with you is through a Teams meeting. Teams meetings can be scheduled through Outlook as though you were scheduling a “normal” meeting (click the Teams button when you create the meeting invite – this button appears in the desktop version of Outlook once you have the Teams application installed on your computer). They can also be scheduled through Outlook on the Web or Outlook Mobile, and through the calendar in the Teams app itself.</p>
<p>When you schedule a Teams meeting with an individual or a group of people, the recipients of the calendar invite will see a clickable Teams Meeting link in the invitation. When they click the Teams Meeting link they can either join through the Teams application (if they have installed it) or through a modern web browser.</p>
<p>The individuals you invite don’t need to be Teams users – anyone can join a Teams meeting – this makes it the easiest and most reliable method of collaborating with externals as with other methods (noted below) the outcome partly depends on the setup outside of QM i.e. the other user’s organisation, which QM cannot control.</p>
<p><strong>Other Options</strong></p>
<p>The limitation of Teams Meetings is that your collaboration opportunities are confined to meetings, as opposed to being ad hoc and asynchronous. You don’t see presence information for those individuals outside of the meeting, and they don’t have access to the resources of any Teams which you have set up. Sometimes this is desirable and appropriate, but not always, in which case there are further options to collaborate externally and to “bring people in” to a fuller Teams experience. The main issue with the other options is that each can be frustrated by restrictions/limitations which may have been placed on access by the IT provider of the 3rd party. Our suggestion is to “just try them” and see what happens, but there can be no guarantees that the external user is able to communicate / collaborate outside of a Teams Meeting. This means it’s unrealistic to expect Teams to replace email altogether, though hopefully you will drastically cut down your use of email.</p>
<p>In addition to meetings, Microsoft Teams gives you two different ways to communicate and collaborate with people outside your organization.</p>
<p>The first – external access – lets you find, call, and chat with users in other organisations (for example UCL – people with email address format of ucl.ac.uk). The second – guest access – lets you add individuals to your teams, as guests, using their email address. You can collaborate with guests as you would with any other users in your organization (within a Team/channel, once they are added to your Team).</p>
<p>You can use both external access and guest access if you want - one does not preclude the other.</p>
<p>At a high level, here’s how to choose (for a detailed comparison, see the table at the end of this article)</p>
<p><strong>External Access</strong></p>
<p>Use external access when you need a solution that lets external users in other domains find, call, chat, and set up meetings with you. External users have no access to your organization's teams or team resources. Choose external access when you want to communicate with external users who are still on Skype for Business or Skype.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to external access and the outcome partly depends on whether the other organisation is using Teams and any limitations their IT Dept have placed on external access from their end. QM has no restrictions and allows external access with any organisation. If you’re unable to reach the other party using external access, you try Guest access or you can just invite them to a Teams meeting.</p>
<p>In order to start an interaction with external access, click the “New chat” icon to the left of the search bar at the top of teams. Paste in the email address of the user and hit enter. You may (depending on how they’re set up) be able to send them a message and see their presence. Assuming this works you should also be able to call them.</p>
<p>Currently QMUL is in transition from using Skype as default communication tool in Office 365, to using Teams. Until this transition is completed (planned for Summer 2020), messages from external users to QMUL users sent by the method described above, will arrive in Skype. If you want external users to have access to teams and channels, guest access might be a better way to go.</p>
</div>
<h3>Do you need to download the app to join a Teams call?</h3>
<div>
<p>No, you don't need the app to join a call or even participate in Teams, just a modern web browser (not Internet Expolrer). However, downloading the ap gives you all the most useful features - background effects, multiple people tiled on the screen etc.</p>
</div>
<h3>If I create a team, can I invite someone to the meeting without me being present?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, just set up the meeting in the channel, and then you don't need to join</p>
</div>
<h3>How do you know if your guest has accepted your invitation? Can people join without an invite?</h3>
<div>
<p>In the case of a meeting invite - you can see this in your calendar assuming the recipient responded to the meeting invite - a Teams meeting is really just a calendar meeting. In the case of inviting a guest as a member of your team, you don't currently receive confirmation that they accepted your invitation though you could ask them to post a message to the team confirming they have access. Anyone can be invited, but in order to join, you need the meeting link</p>
</div>
<h3>Can you add a whole group of students to this?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes! Class Teams are a great way to work with students</p>
</div>
<h3>If I schedule a regular Teams meeting does this automatically call all in a Team at that time? If so, what happens if one of the meetings fall on a day when one member of team is on leave?</h3>
<div>
<p>When you schedule a teams meeting in a channel, it will initiate the meeting at the time scheduled and prompt people to join, but not actively call them</p>
</div>
<h3>Do meetings you add to your Teams calendar sync with Outlook?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, they do and vice versa</p>
</div>
<h3>How do I switch on captions and personalise or blur the background photo?</h3>
<div>
<p>In a call, tap the three dots on the Teams calling bar, then chose switch on captions or show background effects. You need the desktop version for this</p>
</div>
<h3>What is the lobby?</h3>
<div>
<p>The lobby is a waiting room. You can use it with external participants to have them wait while you meet internal collagues and then let them in when you are ready, for example. It can't be used currently with internal people, but this is coming. Any presenter can admit people in the lobby</p>
</div>
<h3>Can you add as many people as you want to a meeting?</h3>
<div>
<p>Pretty much - 250 in each Teams Meeting, 5000 people in a Team, you can be a mamber of 1000 Teams - but less is best!</p>
</div>
<h3>Can people still see you (if video is on) if you are looking at a different tab during a meeting?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes</p>
</div>
<h3>If you leave the chat, do you still get access to whatever is on the chat following your departure?</h3>
<div>
<p>If you leave a chat, you cease to be able to access it and all content</p>
</div>
<h3>When you mute all, do they have control to unmute?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, they can unmute. Just like in physical meetings, you can't control what people say and when they say it</p>
</div>
<h3>Can only one person share screen at any one time?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, just one</p>
</div>
<h3>Can you rejoin a meeting once you've left?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, as long as the organiser has not ended the meeting using the end meeting now button</p>
</div>
<h3>How do you make someone else an owner?</h3>
<div>
<p>First make them a member, then change their ststus in the settings tab - or add them as an owner in the first place</p>
</div>
<h3>Can you remove yourself from a Team?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, just tap leave in the three dots menu next to the Team name. If you are the last owner, you will need to delete the Team or add someone else as an owner before leaving</p>
</div>
<h3>What is the request control button?</h3>
<div>
<p>You can request control over a screen share to work on that document or app. The person whose computer it is needs to allow the control and can stop it at any time</p>
</div>
<h3>Are the files in the Teams/Files area separate to the documents area in Sharepoint</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, when a team is set up, a sharepoint site is created to store the documents, but this is separate from other sharepoint sites you may have</p>
</div>
<h3>How can you organise file sharing in Teams?</h3>
<div>
<p>Files are shared with others in the Team, and by clicking 'get link', they can be shared internally, but only if the recipient has access, just as in Sharepoint. These are deleted with the chat after six months</p>
</div>
<h3>Are the shared files encrypted?</h3>
<div>
<p>When you share a link, you are only sharing the link. When editing or viewing, the connection and the content is secure and encrypted. Sharing externally from Teams is possible but you need to open the team file store in SharePoint and share from there. There is the option to block download and only allow viewing. File storage is very secure as it is based in SharePoint, stored in the UK in Microsoft's secure datacentres, backed up in Europe. Microsoft storage is SAS70 certified, which is the highest security standard. It is enrypted end to end when you access it</p>
</div>
<h3>Do the files that you upload into a team or a channel get uploaded to SharePoint too?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, Teams file storage is just another way of looking at a SharePoint site, so they actually live in SharePoint and are just viewed through Teams</p>
</div>
<h3>How is the Document Library different from Files?</h3>
<div>
<p>Sharepoint can have many document libraries. Teams has one folder per Team channel in a single parent document library which lives in the Sharepoint site owned by the Team. To summarise, Files is a folder in a document library</p>
</div>
<h3>So can we use other apps like OneNote?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes</p>
</div>
<h3>Are meeting notes visible to everyone or just you?</h3>
<div>
<p>Meeting notes ar visible to everyone in the meeting, but are saved to the OneDrive of the person who clicks on the create meeting notes link. So technically, that person owns them</p>
</div>
<h3>With sharing, I've shared word documents before, but can you also share a PDF?</h3>
<div>
<p>Not in the same way, only office documents can be shared in a granular way</p>
</div>
<h3>Is there a limit to the size of the SharePoint site we can integrate into teams?</h3>
<div>
<p>There is no limit to what you can add to Teams. SharePoint sites have large storage capacity, that is not easily filled. The actual capacity depends on how the whole of Office 365 is set up - the total space available is shared across all sites</p>
</div>
<h3>How can I find the location of files that are stored in Teams?</h3>
<div>
<p>Each Team has one default file storage location, in the files tab. It's a SharePoint site and can be synced to your desktop if you wish</p>
</div>
<h3>Which is better, SharePoint or OneDrive for meeting files?</h3>
<div>
<p>OneDrive is broadly for your files, SharePoint is for group owned files. Both could be places for meeting files, but if they need to be shared with a group, SharePoint or teams files may be the best option</p>
</div>
<h3>Is there a way to export chats for permanent storage?</h3>
<div>
<p>No, chat is kept for six months after the last activity and then permanently deleted</p>
</div>
<h3>Does Teams pick up out of office messages?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes - Teams will apply the same out of office message</p>
</div>
<h3>Can you stop notifications of extra people being added to the meeting flooding everyone's email inbox?</h3>
<div>
<p>This should not happen if you add the users in Outlook desktop or Outlook on the Web</p>
</div>
<h3>What is 'post to multiple channels'?</h3>
<div>
<p>If you are in a Team with lots of channels and you want to post the same message to all of them, you can use the post to multiple channels to make it easier, this can even be into channels across multiple teams</p>
</div>
<h3>How do I stop other group messages coming through whilst I am on another meeting?</h3>
<div>
<p>Set your presence to 'do not disturb'</p>
</div>
<h3>Zoom has the "raise hand" feature so that the organiser can keep track of who wants to talk next. Is this available in Teams?</h3>
<div>
<p>Raise hand is now available in Teams</p>
</div>
<h3>what is the quickest way to have a private conversation with one or more people individually whilst the meeting is ongoing?</h3>
<div>
<p>Either find them in chat, or from inside the meeting, hover over their name and you can message them privately</p>
</div>
<h3>If you've hidden a team and someone @s you, will you be notified?</h3>
<div>
<p>If you are mentioned directly, you will be notified</p>
</div>
<h3>If I add new people to the team do they see the historic chat or only from the point they joined?</h3>
<div>
<p>In a Team, they will see all historic information. In a chat you can decide what new members see</p>
</div>
<h3>Is there a search function to look for a particular topic discussed in a chat?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, the search is magnificent! Search files, chat, messages… anything</p>
</div>
<h3>How do you do delete chats?</h3>
<div>
<p>You can delete your own posts in chat and in Teams conversations</p>
</div>
<h3>Can you restrict access on a channel so not everyone on the team can access it?</h3>
<div>
<p>Yes, create a private channel</p>
</div>
<h3>Can you meet now with someone not in any of your teams or do you have to schedule that?</h3>
<div>
<p>You can call them to meet from a private chat</p>
</div>
<h3>How long are meeting recordings held for? Are you recording the subtitles too if you have turned them on?</h3>
<div>
<p>If scheduled via outlook and therefore saved into a chat, the recording is available for 6 months after all activity in the chat has ceased. Subtitles are not recorded in a meeting. However, the recording is transcribed when the video is saved - you can access this transcript through Mircorosft Stream. Click the three dots next to the video and open with Stream. If it is in a supported language, you'll see the transcript. It does not yet attribute what was said to each speaker, but this is coming in a few months</p>
</div>
<h3>Who has access to the recording and is it stored forever?</h3>
<div>
<p>Access to recordings is for the people who are invited to the meeting. These recordings are saved into Microsoft Stream and linked to the meeting chat. They are kept by default for 6 months after the chat is no longer in use. If you meet in a channel, the recording stays until the Team is deleted. To stop anyone from recording your meeting (when you want to protect the content of group) make them attendees. If multiple people record the meeting, only one recording can be made of each meeting. All presenters can start and stop the recording</p>
</div>
<h3>There is a management planning issue for people leaving Queen Mary and we then cannot manage what they left</h3>
<div>
<p>Teams without owners can be problematic, this is why we suggest adding more than one owner. With evidence of management approval, the service desk can add new owners to existing Teams. Members access is terminated with closure of their IT account</p>
</div>
<h3>Are there any GDPR issues?</h3>
<div>
<p>All content is GDPR and FOI compliant, and Office 365 has a compliance centre to handle this. Microsoft is a leading supplier of cloud services for government, military, healthcare, and many of the largest companies in the world, as well as a majority of educational institutions. You can look at the Trust center for an up to date list of certifications / accreditations and audit reports of the Microsoft 365 platform</p>
</div>
<h3>How to connect your Jabra speaker to use MS Teams?</h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>Set up a Teams meeting and invite participants as normal</span></li>
<li><span>One colleague in the room plugs the <strong>Jabra portable</strong> speaker into <strong>a</strong> USB port of their laptop, and joins the Teams meeting, ensuring that their speaker and microphone are activated </span></li>
<li><span>Ensure that the speaker is located in the centre of the group as far as possible</span></li>
<li><span>The remote colleagues join the Teams meeting as normal with cameras, speakers turned on.</span></li>
<li>Participants who are in-room join the Teams meeting with their speaker and microphone muted (to prevent “howl around”) but with their cameras activated</li>
<li><span>All colleagues should then be able to see all participants wherever they are, and participate in the Teams “Chat”</span></li>
<li><span>All colleagues will be able to display materials on the laptop screens</span></li>

<div id="accordion">
<h3>How is a Teams Live Event different from a Teams Meeting?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are two main differences: - in Teams Meetings, any participant can unmute their mic, or share their video feed or screen content. Teams Live Events is a broadcasting platform where only nominated presenters can speak or share video and content to the audience. - Teams Meetings can currently accommodate 250 people, while Live Events can have up to 10,000 audience members.</p>
</div>
<h3>Can I use Teams Live Events on a mobile device?</h3>
<div>
<p>You can watch a Live Event on an iOS or Android device as an audience member, but you cannot produce a Live Event on these platforms. You’ll need to download Microsoft Stream app on your device to watch.</p>
</div>
<h3>Can I use Teams Live Events in a web browser?</h3>
<div>
<p>You can watch a Live Event in a web browser as an audience member, but you cannot produce a Live Event from a browser. You need to install the MS Teams Client on your computer to produce an event.</p>
